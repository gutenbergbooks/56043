<h2 id="PUBLISHERS_NOTE">PUBLISHERS’ NOTE.</h2>

<p>The rapid exhaustion of the first edition of Mr. <span class="smcap">Owen Glynne
Jones’</span> book on ‘Rock-climbing in the English Lake District,’
and further numerous enquiries for copies of this unique and
invaluable work, induced us to make arrangements for the
publication of another issue. A third edition has now become
necessary.</p>

<p>Since the first edition appeared in 1897, several important
new climbs have been made, most of which have been written
about by the author, and are here found just as they left his pen.
Of some of the other climbs nothing had been written, so, in
response to the request of several climbing friends, two appendices,
bringing the book up to date, have been added. The memoir by
Mr. W. M. Crook, which is accompanied by an excellent portrait
of Mr. Jones, will, we are sure, be welcomed by all as a valuable
addition to the work.</p>

<p>We are glad to avail ourselves of this opportunity of acknowledging
the kindness of several friends for much valuable
advice and assistance given.</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>I feel I owe a word of apology to the readers of this
brief and inadequate memoir of a dead friend. At
the request of Jones’ most intimate friends I have
compiled it in the scanty leisure moments of a few
weeks of a busy life, too few to do justice to my
theme. I wish to return my heartiest thanks to
those of his friends who have so quickly and generously
aided me with the materials at their disposal,
especially to Mr. F. W. Hill, Dr. W. E. Sumpner,
the brothers Abraham, of Keswick; Mr. W. J.
Williams, Mr. Harold Spender, and M. Spahr, of
Evolena. I hope if any inaccuracies are detected by
these or other friends, they will communicate with
me. It has been difficult to avoid them, for all the
written documents do not agree in facts and dates.
I trust, however, that this brief record of great effort,
great achievement, and great tragedy will be more
acceptable than no record at all.</p>

<span class="large"><i>EARLY LIFE AND FIRST CLIMBS</i></span></h2>

<p>Owen Glynne Jones was born on November 2nd,
1867. A Welshman by blood, he was a Londoner
by birth, for he first saw the light of day in Clarendon
Street, Paddington. His father, Mr. David
Jones, was a carpenter and builder, and the son
commenced his education at a local school. Of his
early life there is little to tell. He seems to have
spent his holidays in Wales, and there to have
developed, among what may without inaccuracy be
called his native mountains, that passion for climbing
which made him famous, and which led to his early
and much lamented death.</p>

<p>In 1881, when not yet fourteen years of age,
Owen Jones was sent to the Central Foundation
School in Cowper Street, City Road, of which Dr.
Wormell was head master. Those who knew him
there speak of him as ‘a bright, promising schoolboy.’</p>

<p>He remained at Dr. Wormell’s for three years
(1881-1884). He distinguished himself in science
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
and won several prizes while at the school. On
leaving he was awarded the Holl scholarship, and
passed to the Technical College at Finsbury, under
the City and Guilds of London Institute.</p>

<p>Jones spent two years (1884-1886) at Finsbury.
During that time he passed through the complete
course of instruction in the Mechanical department
there. He worked with conspicuous ability and
success at mechanical engineering, mechanical drawing,
mathematics, and chemistry, as well as in the
mechanical laboratory and in the wood and iron
workshops. When he left, his teachers spoke of him
in the highest terms. ‘Mr. O. G. Jones,’ said Professor
Perry, ‘was as able, as earnest, as promising as any
other whom I can now remember.’ Mr. John Castell-Evans
speaks of his ‘eager enthusiasm and scrupulous
conscientiousness;’ and Professor Silvanus Thompson
wrote of him: ‘He is imbued with modern methods,
... and is possessed of a healthy enthusiasm for
his work that is infectious.’ At the close of his
course he passed with a Clothworkers’ Scholarship to
the Central Institution in Exhibition Road, South
Kensington, where he passed the next three years
of his life.</p>

<p>The three years (1886-1889) he spent in the
Engineering Department, and at the end of his
course he had attained the highest position in the
class-list of any student of his year, and he received
the diploma of Associate of the Institute. On the
completion of his course he was appointed assistant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
in the Mathematical Department. During his life
at South Kensington he made the same impression
as heretofore on all with whom he came in contact.
Intellectually alert, diligent, energetic, enthusiastic,
he seemed bound to make some mark in the world.</p>

<p>In the year following the completion of his
course, and while he was an assistant at South
Kensington, I first met him.</p>

<p>It was during the Easter holidays of 1890.
Having broken away from the party with whom
I had been spending most of my holiday in Borrowdale,
I made my way to Wastdale Head Inn. I
picked up a chance acquaintance with two young
fellows in the inn, and we agreed to go together to
climb the Pillar Rock&mdash;with the aid of a ‘Prior’s
Guide’ which I had in my pocket.</p>

<p>When we commenced the ascent, which proved
very easy&mdash;I believe we went up the easiest way&mdash;the
dark, slim young fellow somehow naturally
assumed the lead. Before we started he had discovered
that I had been to Switzerland and had
done some climbs there, so he was very modest
about his own powers. A few seconds on the rocks
dissipated all doubt. With great confidence and
speed, climbing cleanly and safely, he soon showed
he was no ordinary climber. I had been out with
some very tolerable Swiss guides, but never before
with a man to whom rock-climbing seemed so natural
and easy. My curiosity was excited. He could not
be one of the great climbers, for he had never been
out of the British Islands, but he could climb.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span></p>

<p>On the top we found a small, rusty tin box, in
which were a number of visiting cards. One of
these belonged to Mr. A. Evans, of Liverpool, and
a subsequent visitor had written on it the date
of his death in the central gully of Llewedd. One
of us produced a card, on which the other two wrote
their names. The dark young fellow signed his
name ‘O. G. Jones.’ I wonder if that card is there
still.</p>

<p>That afternoon and the following day he plied
me with questions about Switzerland. How did the
climbing there compare with these rocks? Had I
climbed the Matterhorn? Did I think he could do
it?&mdash;absurd question&mdash;and so on. Restless, eagerly
active, very strong, good-tempered, enthusiastic, he
was a man one could not forget. We parted after a
day’s acquaintance. I never dreamed I should see
him again.</p>

<p>His companion on that occasion was another
South Kensington man, Dr. Sumpner, now of Birmingham.
The next time we met was at Jones’s
grave in Evolena. During our conversations at that
first brief meeting I learned that Jones was at South
Kensington; he told me he first learned serious
climbing on Cader Idris; I marvelled at his wonderful
grip of the rocks, his steady head, his extraordinary
power of balancing himself on one foot in
what seemed to me then almost impossible
positions, and I felt that his enthusiasm would soon
lead him to the Alps, if any opportunity offered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
His heart was already there. Yet he was so
ignorant of the ‘lingo’ of the climbing world that
my use of the words ‘handholds’ and ‘footholds’
considerably amused him.</p>

<p>The following Easter he was again among the
Lake Mountains, having devoted the Whitsuntide
and Christmas holidays of the preceding year to his
favourite pursuit, the last mentioned period being
spent in North Wales. I hurry over his climbing
in the Lake District for the very sufficient reason
that in this volume, so characteristic of its author,
his work there is described by himself with all the
accuracy of a trained scientist, and with all the
enthusiasm of an ardent mountaineer. Descriptions
of all these climbs were kept by him in numerous
small notebooks, full of neat shorthand with dates,
proper names, &amp;c., written in, and with occasional
pen and ink sketches of his routes up crags and
gullies to illustrate the shorthand notes. Full of
mournful interest are these touches of a vanished
hand, these silent echoes of a voice that is still.</p>

<p>It was, I believe, during this Easter of 1891 that
he met Mr. Monro, to whose enthusiasm he was
subsequently wont to attribute his first visit to the
Alps, which took place in the autumn of that year.
The result of that meeting and the wonderful
amount of climbing in ‘the playground of Europe’
that Jones managed to cram into eight short years
must be reserved for another chapter.

<span class="large"><i>CONQUERING THE ALPS</i></span></h2>

<p>In the autumn of 1891 Owen Jones was an unsuccessful
candidate for the Professorship of Physics
at University College, Aberystwyth, and almost
immediately afterwards he was the successful candidate
for the post of Physics Master in the City of
London School, which he was occupying at the time
of his death. In the previous year, 1890, he had
taken his B.Sc. degree in London University, coming
out third in the list of First Class Honours in
Experimental Physics. These facts are mentioned
here now, somewhat out of their proper chronological
order, because, with the exception of a few papers he
contributed to magazines (the <i>Alpine Journal</i>, the
<i>Climber’s Journal</i>, and <i>Cassell’s Magazine</i>) and
sundry newspaper articles, they are the only facts
that need be mentioned in his otherwise uneventful,
though busy, life.</p>

<p>Jones’ real life was lived among his beloved
mountains. His devotion to them was unsurpassable,
his zeal was consuming, his enthusiasm knew no
bounds. In the summer holidays of 1891 he had
his first introduction to the Alps. His most original
work was undoubtedly done among the rocks of his
native Wales and in the English Lake country, but
he flung himself into Alpine work with all the ardour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>

and energy of which his peculiarly ardent and
energetic nature was capable. He spared neither
time, money, nor comfort in his devotion to the
noblest and most exacting of all sports&mdash;that of
mountaineering.</p>

<p>The following table&mdash;very imperfect, I fear&mdash;compiled
by his own hand up to the close of 1897,
and for 1898 and 1899, from letters kindly sent to
me by his friends, will give some idea of his marvellous
physical endurance and the extent of his
knowledge of the Alps. His own portion of the list
was found in his handwriting in his copy of Cunningham
and Abney’s ‘Pioneers of the Alps’:&mdash;</p>

<p>I cannot pretend that this list is perfect, and the
brief notes I append are intended rather to give in a
small space some of the points of human interest in
the above bald list of names than for his mountaineering
friends, to whom anything that could be
printed here could convey little or nothing that was
new.</p>

<p>It is a coincidence that he commenced his
acquaintance with the Alps in the very valleys&mdash;Ferpècle
and Arolla&mdash;in which he spent the last
days of his life, and down which his friends mournfully
escorted his body eight years later. It was on
one of the Dents de Veisivi (the Petite Dent) that,
in 1898, Professor Hopkinson, one of Jones’ numerous
climbing friends, met his death with his two
daughters and his son. As we walked down the
Arolla valley the day before he fell from the Dent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
Blanche, Owen Jones was chatting, with a wonderful
freshness of recollection of detail, of his climb up the
Grand Combin during his first season in the Alps,
and I believe the guide who led him up then was
one of the search party from Evolena who found his
body on the rocks of the Dent Blanche.</p>

<p>The earlier climbs of 1892 were described by him
in a paper entitled ‘The Dom Grat and the Fletschhorn
Ridge,’ which appeared in the <i>Alpine Journal</i>
in 1898. A brief quotation from his own account
will give some idea of the easy vivacity of his style.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Saas peaks which ‘were designed
in pairs,’ he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘It is, perhaps, to our credit that we took an
easy pair first&mdash;the Mittaghorn and the Egginer&mdash;but
our stay at Saas that year was to be short,
and we could not afford to fail at higher work. A
couple of Saas loafers undertook to guide us, but
proved to be lamentably weak. They shed tears and
ice-axes, and required much help from us dismayed
amateurs. Then we left the district, and before my
next visit my comrades were scattered over the
globe, beyond the seductive influence of axe and
rope.’</p>

<p>How characteristic of poor Jones the whole of
that passage is! The unconcealed evidence of his
own great physical strength, the playful sense of
humour&mdash;his friends will remember how he used to
explain his own initials, O.G., as standing for the
‘Only Genuine Jones’&mdash;in the words ‘they shed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>
tears and ice-axes,’ and the touch of pathos, in the
light of after events, of the phrase ‘beyond the
seductive influence of axe and rope.’</p>

<p>The omission of the names of the Mittaghorn
and Egginerhorn from Jones’s own list in 1892 shows
that even his own record cannot be regarded as
complete, a thing not to be wondered at considering
the enormous amount of work he did.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that in this year, as in the
year before and in 1894, Jones has entered the
names of peaks and passes that in the succeeding
years he would have considered quite unworthy of
serious notice.</p>

<p>But next year he ventured on a feat that, so far
as I know, was not only extraordinary for one with
comparatively so little experience of the higher
Alps, magnificent climber though he was, but it
has remained, I believe, unique in the annals of the
great mountain on which it was performed. At
Easter, 1893, Jones climbed the Dent Blanche, the
mountain with which his name will be for ever
associated in the climbing world. The ascent was
made on the 25th and 26th April, and the expedition
took thirty-six hours, a wonderful feat of
strength and endurance. M. Adrien Spahr, the
landlord of the Hotel de la Dent Blanche at Evolena,
and of the new Kurhaus at Arolla (from which Jones
started the day before his last, fatal climb), has
kindly favoured me with the following brief note in
reference to that expedition:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p xml:lang="fr">‘C’est bien le 25 Avril, 1893, que Monsieur Jones a fait
l’ascension de la Dent Blanche avec les guides Pierre Gaspoz
et Antoine Bovier père d’Evolène. Je suis redescendu moi-même
avec lui depuis Evolène à Sion.’</p></blockquote>

<p>In an interview which appeared in the press in
1894 Jones said of this climb, one of the most
difficult things he ever did:&mdash;‘The longest day I
ever had afoot was at Easter, ’93, doing the Dent
Blanche. We took two guides and a porter, and
had great difficulty in getting them to attempt the
last two hundred feet. We were out in the open
for thirty-six hours, with very short rests, no sleep,
and excessive labour, but we revelled in every
minute of it. The mountain was in a dangerous
condition, and the last five hours on the way home
we spent in wading, waist-deep, through soft snow.
It was rather painful, of course, but there was a
certain pleasure even in our pain, for it helped to
make philosophers of us. We agreed to think of
other things in the midst of our sufferings, and we
succeeded creditably well. I believe now that I
could stand almost anything in the way of pain or
exposure.’</p>

<p>In 1894 he commenced in the Engadine and then
went on to the Dolomites, where his great skill as a
cragsman and his familiarity with all sorts of rock-work
made him much more at home than he yet was
among the snow-peaks, as his list shows. On rocks
I think it is not using the exaggerated language of
friendship to say that he probably had no superior
among his countrymen at the time of his death, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
comparatively few equals. Among the great snow-peaks
he had not attained so high a level. Had he
lived he would, I believe, have ranked with the
greatest, for he had not done all he was capable of;
and when he met his death he was still in his prime,
and he was a man of great courage, immense
resourcefulness, and phenomenal physical endurance.</p>

<p>In 1895 he devoted himself largely to the
reduction of the great peaks in the Zermatt district,
some of which he already knew. In that year also
he returned to the Dom Grat and the Fletschhorn
Ridge, whose acquaintance he had made in 1892.
The following passage from the <i>Alpine Journal</i>
derives an added interest from the fact that Elias
Furrer was his guide then, as he was his guide on
the last, fatal climb:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘In August, 1895, Elias Furrer took me from the
Täsch Alp to the Mischabeljoch, and thence over the
Täschhorn and Dom to Randa, a course of seventeen
and a half hours, including halts. Shortly afterwards
Mr. W. E. Davidson followed our route from
the Mischabeljoch. During the same week Furrer
showed me a third pair of the Saas peaks. We
bivouacked on the Eggfluh rocks one bitterly cold
night, and next day traversed the Südlenspitze and
Nadelhorn. The usual <i>grande course</i> is to include
the Ulrichshorn, and descend to Saas again; but
Furrer had business and I fresh raiment at Zermatt,
and we hastened over the Stecknadelhorn (or was it
the Hohberghorn?), and thence by the Hohberg
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">xx</span>
Pass and Festi glacier down to Randa in fourteen
hours from the start.’</p>

<p>His energy in climbing this year was remarkable,
I had almost said stupendous. In addition to the
long climbs referred to in the above extract, it will
be seen from the list given above that he twice
ascended the Zinal Rothhorn, traversed the Obergabelhorn
and Matterhorn, and did two important
climbs without guides. The ascent of the Rothhorn
from Zinal was the first that Mr. Hill and he made
together in Switzerland. The traverse of the Rothhorn
and the ascent of the Weisshorn he did without
guides, in company with the Hopkinsons, who
perished in 1898 on the Petite Dent de Veisivi. Mr.
W. J. Williams, who climbed much with Jones in
the Alps, has kindly placed in my hands a very
characteristic post-card of Jones’s, giving, in his own
brief, vivacious way, a clearer idea of his boundless
enthusiasm and energy in his favourite sport than
anything that anyone else could write. It is dated
‘Bellevue, Zermatt, Monday, Sept. 2, 1895,’ and reads
as follows:&mdash;‘The Hopkinsons and I traversed the
Rothhorn without guides in grand style. Reached
the summit from the Mountet in 4&frac14; hours, including
&frac34; hour halt. Had a shock of earthquake on the
top. Next day we went up to the Weisshorn, bivouac
in open air, and the day after managed the Weisshorn.
It was delightful. Then they went off to
their people at the Bel Alp, and I stayed on at
Zermatt ever since. The weather was bad at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span>
end of the week (Weisshorn on Friday), but on
Monday I crossed the Furggenjoch with Elias
Furrer, whom I took on for 14 days at 20 francs, and
Tuesday traversed the Matterhorn; Wednesday, the
Monte Rosa hut; Thursday, Monte Rosa from the
Lysjoch, a lengthy expedition, but magnificent; I
carried my camera the whole time; Friday, the Fluh
Alp; Saturday, the traverse of Rimpfischhorn from
the Adler pass, dangerous by falling stones, but very
jolly; Sunday, I rested and photographed down
here. To-day I go to the Täsch Alp, and to-morrow
shall attempt the traverse of Täschhorn and Dom in
one day. If the weather still holds I shall then
traverse the Dent Blanche, which is now in fine condition,
like ourselves. Love to all.&mdash;Owen.’</p>

<p>Lived there ever a keener mountaineer? On the
day before he was killed, as we were walking down
the Arolla Valley together, I expressed surprise at
the vast amount of eager work he was crushing into
every week. He replied, ‘You see there are only a
few years in which I can do this sort of thing, and I
want to get as much into them as possible.’ Alas!
Owen Jones had not twenty-four hours more; the
years were ended.</p>

<p>The season of 1896 was a terribly bad one and
Jones suffered with less energetic and less daring
mortals. In the <i>Alpine Journal</i> he laments that he
only did six peaks, but he crossed the Col du Géant
twice, traversed the Aiguille de Charmoz, and did
the North peak of the Périades by the Arête du
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">xxii</span>
Capucin. And the disappointments of that summer
season had the effect of sending him to the Alps in
the following winter&mdash;his first winter visit. He
deserted his favourite Christmas hunting grounds,
Wastdale Head Inn and Pen-y-gwrwd, for the Bear
Hotel at Grindelwald. It so happened that I was
there when he arrived. On the last day of 1896 I
had made an unsuccessful attempt on the Schreckhorn
after being out fourteen and a half hours,
and after an accident to the leading guide, which
confined him to bed for three weeks. I returned to
Grindelwald and thence to England. Jones, who
had just come out, determined to climb the Sehreckhorn.
The first attempt failed, as the snow was in
very bad condition, and he only got as far as the
hut, where he spent a far from comfortable night.
A few days later, however, he made a second
attempt with successful results. Both in print and
in manuscript he has left an account of the two
expeditions. I quote a short passage&mdash;it has not
too close a relation to the climbs, but it illustrates
the playful humour which made Jones so charming
and vivacious a companion, alike in an alpine hut or
in the smoke room of ‘P.Y.G.’</p>

<p>‘I approach for a moment with some delicacy
the threadbare topic of the insect population of
alpine huts, the fauna of the alpine bed. In
summertime the traveller must not assume that the
straw on which he lies is more dead than alive.
Carelessness in this respect may cost him his peak
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</span>
next day; he should bring Keating and use it
liberally. But in winter he is almost safe and
unmolested. Some say that the fleas go down to
the valley with the last autumn party, and come up
in the early summer with the first tourists. Others
think that they hibernate in the warmest corners of
the hut and make it a rule to emerge only when it is
well worth while. An occasional winter tourist is
probably too tough, his attractions too few. The
solution of the problem I must leave to others. It
will probably be offered by some conscientious
German biologist, in an exhaustive illustrated monograph,
published in the Mittheilungen.’</p>

<p>The autumn holidays of this year were again
very busy ones. Jones spent them in the Alps, and,
as his list shows, his climbs included the traverse of
the Aletschhorn, Aiguille du Moine, and Pic du Tacul.
He did the Portiengrat and Weissmies in one day,
and the Fletschhorn and Laquinhorn in another.
Young Emil Imseng was his guide, and he found
Jones rather too hungry for peaks to be the easiest
sort of patron to travel with. When they had done
the Portiengrat he had had enough for one day, so
he suggested that Jones should rest. But he did
not know his ‘Herr;’ the Weissmies was taken that
day likewise.</p>

<p>In 1898 Jones again paid a winter visit to the
Alps. Grindelwald was a second time his centre.
He crossed from there to Rosenlaui by the Wetterhorn-Sattel,
and crossed the Finsteraarjoch and the
Strahlegg.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</span></p>

<p>In the Summer of 1898 he went first to
Chamounix, and afterwards to Zermatt, and got
through a portentous amount of work. He began
by attempting the traverse of the two Drus, but
failed owing to bad weather. However, he climbed the
Grand Dru, and then in rapid succession the Grépon,
Dent du Requin, Aiguille du Chardonnet, Aiguille
du Midi, Mont Maudit, traversed Mont Blanc,
climbed the Aiguille du Géant, and finished up in
that district by accomplishing his formerly thwarted
purpose, and traversing both the Grand and the
Petit Dru.</p>

<p>Then he came on to Zermatt. He climbed the
Riffelhorn again (by the Matterhorn Couloir), did
the two peaks of the Lyskamm (in conversation
with me the last time I met him he seemed to think
this the most difficult thing he had ever done) and
Castor, Strahlhorn and Rimpfischhorn, Wellen Kuppe
and Gabelhorn, Allalinhorn and Alphubel, Dent
Blanche (by the south arête), the Täschhorn by the
Teufelsgrat, and the traverse of the Dom, Täschhorn
and Kienhorn.</p>

<p>I was standing outside the Monte Rosa Hotel,
in the main street of Zermatt, one bright sunny day,
that summer, when early in the afternoon Jones,
with his two guides, came in from one of these
climbs. He had been frequently doing two peaks in
one day (I believe he had once done three). All the
party showed signs of wear and tear, but Jones was
the freshest of the three. His face and hands were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">xxv</span>
as brown as berries, covered with dust and sweat;
his clothes were literally in rags, torn to pieces on
the rocks. Yet in a few minutes he had washed,
changed into the garb of civilization, and reappeared
as fresh in body and as vigorous and vivacious intellectually
as if he had undergone no fatigue at all.
Twenty hours’ physical work did not appear to take
as much out of him as five hours does out of humbler
mortals.</p>

<p>It was just about this time that his friends the
Hopkinsons were killed in the Arolla Valley. Jones
was a good deal upset by the news, and knocked off
climbing for a couple of days, a wonderful thing for
him; but then he resumed as busily as ever. Of the
climbing skill both of Dr. Hopkinson and of his
young son, who was killed with him, he spoke in
the highest terms. He had frequently climbed with
both.</p>

<p>I have said little of Jones’s British climbs, for
the simple reason that the fullest and best record of
his work in Lakeland is contained in the book to
which this brief memoir is prefixed, and his work in
Wales (which he also intended to describe in a
volume) is not so easily accessible or so fully recorded
in any published documents as is his work in the
Alps. Apparently there does not exist among his
papers any list of his Welsh climbs, though he kept
voluminous shorthand notes of almost everything he
did in the climbing world; but it is not possible, in
the short space and time at my disposal, to attempt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</span>
to give from them any complete picture of the work
he did in Wales. The Messrs. Abraham, however,
have kindly placed in my hands the following brief
notes of some of the most remarkable experiences
they have had in company with Jones, both in Wales
and in the Lake District:</p>

<p>‘Two climbs with Mr. Jones are most strongly
impressed on our memories, and these two would
probably rank as the two finest rock climbs made in
our district.</p>

<p>‘These are Scawfell Pinnacle from the second
pitch in Deep Ghyll in 1896, and the conquest of
the well-known Walker’s Gully on the Pillar Rock
in January, 1899.</p>

<p>‘Both of these were generally considered impossible,
and it is probably no exaggeration to say
that no leader excepting Mr. Jones would have had
confidence to advance beyond the ledge where the
last <i>arête</i> commenced on the Scawfell Pinnacle
climb.</p>

<p>‘The same thing might be still more emphatically
said of the last pitch in Walker’s Gully, and to those
who know the place it is almost incredible that the
climb could even be commenced under such conditions
as prevailed during the first ascent.</p>

<p>‘We visited North Wales with Mr. Jones in 1897,
and explored the climbs in the Cader Idris district.
The finest climb in this district is the Great Gully
above Llyn-y-Cae on Mynydd Pencoed, and Mr.
Jones was the first explorer and climber of this and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</span>
most of the Cader Idris climbs. Some time was
also spent at Penygwryd during this visit, but
unsuitable weather prevented any climbs of importance
being done.</p>

<p>‘Shortly after Easter, 1899, Mr. Jones paid his
next visit to North Wales, and on this occasion
much new and first-class climbing was done from
Ogwen Cottage as centre.</p>

<p>‘The second ascent of Twll Du was made by a
party led by Mr. Jones, and shortly afterwards the
two great gullies to the right of Twll Du were first
ascended under Mr. Jones’ leadership. Amongst
several minor first ascents the gully in the Eastern
Buttress of Glyder Fach and the first direct ascent
of the Northern Buttress on Tryfaen from Cwm-y-Tryfaen
are most worthy of note.</p>

<p>‘The following Whitsuntide again saw Mr. Jones
at Ogwen Cottage, but the weather conditions were
such as to prevent any very notable climbing being
recorded.</p>

<p>‘Of course it is impossible to give in the space at
my disposal any idea of the large amount of climbing
done in these various districts by Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>‘To one with his abnormal physical powers, and
true love and enthusiasm for the mountains the most
was generally made of every opportunity to climb.</p>

<p>‘He was never so happy as when in a really
‘tight’ place, and to many climbers the spirit and
energy shown by him under most trying circumstances
will act as an incentive to worthy imitation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</span></p>

<p>‘As a climber he was unique, and many years
must elapse ere another can hope to fill his place
worthily; but, as a friend under all circumstances,
he was always to be depended upon, for the weakest
and heaviest members in every party were generally
his special care, and many can never forget his true
unselfishness and the kindly way in which personal
blunders were criticised.</p>

<p>‘Whether the party was struggling up a waterfall
or resting shivering and wet under a huge chock-stone,
or clinging desperately to a wind-swept
ridge or icy couloir, everyone felt happy with Jones
as their comforter and leader.</p>

<p>‘The musical gatherings in the evenings seem
now to lack one voice, and nought but sadness can
be left for many of those who remember companionships
which can never be replaced.’

<span class="large"><i>THE LAST SEASON IN THE ALPS</i></span></h2>

<p>I come now to the last season in the Alps, the
season of 1899. The first part of his holiday was
spent at Zermatt, and then he and Hill met by
arrangement at the Kurhaus at Arolla. They soon
got to work, beginning with the two Dents de
Veisivi (the scene of the accident to the Hopkinsons
the previous year) and the Dent Perroc, in twelve
hours from the Kurhaus and back. Then followed
the Aiguille de la Za by the face, a traverse of all
the peaks of the Aiguilles Rouges, Mont Blanc de
Seilon and the Pigne d’Arolla in one day, the Dent
des Bouquetins, and the traverse of Mont Collon.
A slight accident to one of the party of which I was
a member, necessitated an unexpected descent on
the evening of August 26th to Arolla, in the hope
of finding a doctor. There was none there, but we
found many friends and acquaintances, among them
being Owen Jones. On the morning of Sunday
27th, our party left for Evolena just after breakfast,
as we heard there was a German doctor there, and
we wanted our wounded member attended to
without delay. Just as we were starting we found
Jones and Hill leaving also, intending to traverse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">xxx</span>
the Dent Blanche, climbing it by the west arête,
which had only been done twice before, and we all
hoped shortly to meet again in Zermatt.</p>

<p>It was a bright sunny morning, hot and dusty.
For a good part of the way from Arolla to Haudères
I chatted to Jones. We did not go very fast on
account of the damaged member of our party, about
whom Jones was very solicitous. He himself seemed
very fit, and was full of life and enthusiasm for his
favourite passion. He chatted freely of all his
climbs, of our first meeting nine years before, of all
that had happened since, of frostbite on the Dom,
and the remedy&mdash;sticking his fingers into boiling
glue&mdash;worse than the disease. His traverse of the
ice arête between the two peaks of the Lyskamm
and his Easter ascent of the Dent Blanche seemed
to me to have made the deepest impression on him
of all his achievements in the mountains. He was
rather inclined to underrate his wonderful rock-work
in North Wales and in the Lake District, a department
in which, in my opinion, he was really greatest,
though his feats of endurance in the Alps were
something off the common. He told me that his
ambitions inclined towards a tour in the Himalayas,
if circumstances allowed of his realising that dream.</p>

<p>At Haudères we parted company. Hill and
Jones, with their guides, who met them at Haudères,
turned up to Ferpècle; we went on to Evolena. If
my friend’s health permitted, I had arranged to see
Jones in Zermatt on Tuesday afternoon. Difficult as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</span>
was the expedition he was undertaking, the awful
reality of the morrow never crossed my mind even as
a possibility. A stronger or more well-equipped
party I had never seen start on an expedition. It
was about 12-30 when we all said good-bye.</p>

<p>At Evolena the doctor ordered our invalid a day
or two of complete rest. So on Monday morning
the third member of our party, with his guide,
started for the Col de la Meina to return to his wife,
whom he had left in the Val des Bagnes, from which
we had come. For the sake of the walk I accompanied
them to the top of the Col. About 9-15, just
before we lost sight of the west arête of the Dent
Blanche, I searched the arête with my field glasses
to see if any trace of Jones and Hill’s party could be
detected. None of us could see anything, so we
concluded, as the mountain was in very good condition,
that they had probably already got to the
top, and were then descending by the south arête.
But they were still on the arête, though we failed to
see them on the dark rocks. Had it been three-quarters
of an hour later we might actually have
been witnesses of the accident.</p>

<p>On the top of the Col de la Meina we were
caught by a storm of mist and rain, blowing up from
the west. I bade adieu to my friends and hastened
back to Evolena. That was the mist which caught
Mr. Hill on the gendarme in his descent after the
accident and detained him 22 hours alone on the
great mountain.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</span></p>

<p>But of the accident no one dreamed. No premonition,
no presentiment, troubled our thoughts.
Monday and Tuesday passed quietly and uneventfully
for us.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning my friend got permission
from his doctor to walk up to Arolla for lunch. We
gladly availed ourselves of the new freedom.</p>

<p>At Arolla we found many of Jones’s friends
hoping to meet him shortly in the Zermatt Valley.
On our way back to Evolena we passed the body of
the Tiroler guide, Reinstadler, of Sulden, which was
being carried down the valley. He had been killed
on Monday, August 28th&mdash;that black and fatal day
in the Evolena Valley&mdash;by falling into a crevasse on
the Pigne d’Arolla.</p>

<p>As we re-entered the garden of our hotel, M.
Spahr met us looking very grave. ‘Had we heard
of the great accident on the Dent Blanche?’ For
the first time the thought of danger to Jones and
Hill crossed my mind. I quickly asked him for
details, telling him why I was apprehensive.</p>

<p>He had had a telegram from Dr. Seiler from
Zermatt, which he showed me. It was in French
and ran something like this: ‘A tourist and three
guides have fallen from the Dent Blanche. A caravan
of guides is starting from Zermatt to look for
the bodies, which will reach Haudères about six
o’clock to-morrow evening. Have four coffins
ready at Haudères. I am coming round myself.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Seiler.</span>’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</span></p>

<p>Four bodies! This could not be Jones and Hill’s
party, there would be five or three, for they had
intended to make the ascent on two ropes, three and
two respectively on each. If all five had been roped
together, one could not have been saved. My mind
grew easier. So we reason when we do not know.</p>

<p>But I could not avoid thinking of the awful
accident, and as I thought my fears returned. No
other party had left the Evolena Valley for the Dent
Blanche that week. The bodies had fallen on the
Evolena side. It was improbable they had climbed
from the Zermatt side. Could it be that the fifth
body had not been seen? One climber and three
guides was a most unusual party? I grew uneasy
again, and finally telegraphed to Dr. Seiler: ‘Have
Messrs. Jones and Hill arrived?’</p>

<p>While we were waiting for dinner and a reply, a
voice hailed me by name out of the gathering gloom.
It was that of Mr. Harold Spender, who had just
driven up the valley with his sister and a younger
brother, Mr. Hugh Spender. We exchanged greetings
and discussed the accident. I told them what
I feared.</p>

<p>We were sitting in the balcony outside the hotel
in the summer darkness when a villager put a yellow
telegraph envelope in my hand. I hastily tore it
open, and this is what I read: ‘M. Hill arrived
safely this morning, but Jones and three guides fell
an hour and a half from the top on Monday morning.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Seiler.</span>’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiv">xxxiv</span></p>

<p>Owen Glynne Jones was dead. My mind almost
reeled at the fact. Intellectually I knew it must be
so, but I was utterly unable to realise it. I could
almost hear the sound of his voice and the rattle of
the nails of his dusty boots on the stones that last
Sunday morning. But his voice was stilled for ever.</p>

<p>And Hill! He had escaped, but how? Where
had he been since Monday morning? Out on the
mountain alone, without guides, or food, or drink.
The thing was incredible, impossible. But the
impossible and the incredible was true.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock fifteen guides and Mr. Harold
Spender started as a search party. My injured
friend and myself went with them as far as we
could. The little village was already in darkness,
swathed in sorrow. For the telegram that brought
me news of Jones’ death announced the death of a
village guide too.</p>

<p>In the chapel only lights burned. It was the
vigil round the body of Reinstadler. Silently and
sadly we tramped up the valley along the carriage
road to Haudères. Then in single file, like an army
on a night march, we marched up the steep and
narrow path to Ferpècle. Far below us, on our
right, the torrent roared. We picked precarious
steps by the light of our lanterns and the aid of our
axes. We talked little and in muffled tones.</p>

<p>We reached Ferpècle about 1.30 a.m. on Thursday.
The hamlet was asleep. The guides broke
eight huge poles out of the fences of the fields and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxv">xxxv</span>
from the outbuildings. Grim duty! The poles were
to make four rude biers on which to carry the bodies
down.</p>

<p>Between 3 and 4 a.m. we gained the Bricolla
Alp, where Jones and Hill had slept the night
before the fatal climb. The kindly shepherd provided
us with milk and a fire&mdash;it was now very
cold&mdash;and we produced provisions from our rücksacks
and had a much-needed meal. It was a curious
sight&mdash;the little stone hut, a big wood fire blazing
in a hole in the floor, pails of milk all round the walls
on shelves, a circle of rough weather-beaten men,
their faces lighted by the flickering flames and by
the uncertain light of one or two of our lanterns.
Rembrandtesque&mdash;and profoundly sad.</p>

<p>A little after four we went out. The grey dawn
was just breaking, but a cold, thick, clammy white
mist had swept down on the alp and chilled us to
the bone. At the top of the moraine my friend and
I had to turn back. We should only have been a
hindrance had we gone on, as both of us were
damaged. Spender and the guides went forward.
Let Mr. Spender describe the rest.</p>

<p>‘At four the column resumed its way. Rain
had begun to fall and a dense mist was closing down
upon us. But it was soon light enough to put out
our lanterns, and courage came with the dawn. We
rounded the alp, and then began to climb the long,
dreary moraines which lead up to the glacier. The
guides went at a terrific pace. But it was good to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvi">xxxvi</span>
be taken into this noble fraternity&mdash;to be accepted
as a comrade and not as a “climber”&mdash;to be honoured
by a share in the generous quest.</p>

<p>‘But the pace soon slackened. We halted on
the edge of the glacier, roped in fours, and began to
search gingerly for a way through the terrific ice-fall
of the glacier. We were mounting by the old
approach to the Dent Blanche, up the ice-fall, now
long since abandoned. The glacier was, of course,
quite changed since any of these guides had last
visited it. The ice was split and rent into every
conceivable shape. We were surrounded with leaning
towers of ice, threatening at any moment to fall
on us and crush us.</p>

<p>‘A great pile of seracs on the Northern ice-fall,
across the ridge, fell with a mighty crash. Away to
the right we could hear the thunder of avalanches.
But never for a moment did the guides hesitate.
Steadily and unflinchingly they threaded their way
between the menacing seracs. Crossing broken fragments
of ice, balancing between profound crevasses,
not thwarted but ever searching for a way. At last
we suddenly struck upon the tracks of Jones’ party
away to the North side of the glacier close to the
rocks. There we scrambled up, half by the rocks
and half by the ice, and then at last, after many
hours, found ourselves on the great plateau beneath
the long snow couloir running down from the West
Ridge. There, if anywhere, they were likely to be.
And there, high up among the rocks, we could just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvii">xxxvii</span>
see, with the aid of a good telescope, some dark
objects which were not rocks.</p>

<p>‘“There are our friends,” said the guides.</p>

<p>‘Yes, there was no doubt of it. It was now ten
o’clock and the sky had cleared. A party was
formed, and mounted the rocks to fetch the bodies.
As they climbed, suddenly another army of men
appeared below us, above the ice-fall, advancing
swiftly. They were the party of the Zermatt Guides.
They came on unroped, climbing fast. It was a
magnificent sight to see this troop of giants in their
own element, a troop of equals, masters of peril.
They halted below the rocks and sent up another
small band to join the Evolena Guides. There was
a long pause, and then they all began to descend,
bringing the bodies.</p>

<p>‘I will draw a veil over what we found. Men
cannot fall many thousands of feet and lie in artistic
attitudes.... But it was four o’clock before the
Bricolla hut was reached, and darkness had fallen
before the bodies came to Haudères. The Zermatt
Guides were out for twenty-four hours, and the
Evolena Guides over twenty.’</p>

<p>Mr. W. R. Rickmers, a German resident in
England, and a member of the Alpine Club, sends the
following to the <i>Alpine Journal</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Mr. Seiler sent out thirty guides under Alois
Supersaxo. Dr. R. Leuk, Mr. K. Mayr, and Mr.
W. R. Rickmers joined them. We left the Staffelalp
at 10 p.m. on August 30th, reached the Col
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxviii">xxxviii</span>
d’Hérens at 6 a.m. on the 31st, in fog and snow,
which cleared away later on. Descended Ferpècle
Glacier towards termination of W. ridge of Dent
Blanche, and ascended the small glacier which comes
down from point 3,912 on the S. <i>arête</i>. At the spot
under the “g” in “Rocs rouges” this glacier forms
an icefall (moderately difficult), and besides that a bit
of the Glacier de la Dent Blanche hangs over the
narrowest part of the W. ridge. We then came to
the foot of a great gully. On the map it is the first
one from W., and it is very clearly indicated. In
the rocks to the right of the couloir (looking down)
and about three hundred feet above the rim of the
glacier, the bodies were found. It was about 10 a.m.,
and a party of Evolena guides, accompanied by Mr.
Harold Spender, was already on the spot.</p>

<p>‘The height above sea-level was ca. 3,600-3,700 m.
Straight above, on the ridge, one saw a smooth cliff
(ca. 400-500 feet below summit), and if that was the
fatal <i>mauvais pas</i> the fall must have been about
1,500-1,700 feet in a series of clear drops of many
hundred feet. The rope was intact between Furrer
and Zurbriggen.</p>

<p>‘The guides did their work well; the icefall, of
course, caused a great deal of trouble.’</p>

<p>While the search party was crossing the glacier
and the snow-fields, I watched them through my
glasses. Presently the sun got the better of the
morning mist, and the pure white snow gleamed
beautifully. Then from the Col d’Hérens there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxix">xxxix</span>
swept a tiny, serpentine black line, moving fast.
It was men. I turned my glasses on them. They
were the Zermatt party, some thirty strong, advancing
at a rare pace. It was a beautiful sight, so
masterful, so sure was their progress.</p>

<p>As the long, hot hours of mid-day passed, I
descended to Ferpècle, and sent up a boy with food
and drink for the certainly wearied searchers when
they returned from their sad duties. At length they
came, drawing the bodies over the grass slopes till
they reached a path where they could be carried on
their shoulders. Darkness had fallen when we
reached Haudères.</p>

<p>Late on Friday night Mr. Hill came round for
the funeral. His voice seemed to me strangely
altered. Otherwise he had come through his
terrible experience wonderfully, thanks to a splendid
constitution and nerves of steel. Then first
I heard the true story of the accident. I reproduce
his own account from the <i>Alpine Journal</i>. All had
roped together early in the climb, and the accident
took place about ten o’clock. Mr. Hill says:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘When I reached the level of the others, Furrer
was attempting to climb the buttress, but, finding
no holds, he called to Zurbriggen to hold an axe for
him to stand on. Apparently he did not feel safe,
for he turned his head and spoke to Jones, who then
went to hold the axe steady. Thus we were all on
the same level, Vuignier being some twenty-five or
thirty feet distant from them and also from me.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xl">xl</span>
Standing on the axe, which was now quite firm,
Furrer could reach the top of the buttress, and
attempted to pull himself up; but the fingerholds
were insufficient, and before his foot had left the
axe his hands slipped, and he fell backwards on to
Zurbriggen and Jones, knocking them both off, and
all three fell together. I turned to the wall to get
a better hold, and did not see Vuignier pulled off,
but heard him go, and knew that my turn would
soon come. And when it did not I looked round,
and saw my four companions sliding down the slope
at a terrific rate, and thirty feet of rope swinging
slowly down below me.</p>

<p>‘It is difficult to analyse my sensations at that
moment. My main feeling was one of astonishment
that I was still there. I can only suppose that
Vuignier had belayed my rope securely to protect
himself and me during our long wait on the traverse.</p>

<p>‘It must be admitted that Furrer did not choose
the best route; but his choice is easy enough to understand,
for the only alternative did not look inviting.
At all events, it is certain that he acted on his own
initiative. I say this reluctantly, and solely for the
purpose of contradicting a statement I have read in
an account of the accident&mdash;that he was induced by
Jones to climb straight over the gendarme instead
of going round it. It is a pity that historians, who
must of necessity be ignorant of the facts, should go
out of their way to make such conjectures.</p>

<p>‘The problem before me was a difficult one. It
was quite impossible to climb down alone, and I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xli">xli</span>
could not expect to succeed where guides had failed;
the only course open was to attempt to turn the
gendarme on the right. This I succeeded in doing
with great difficulty, owing to the ice on the rocks
and the necessity of cutting up an ice slope in order
to reach the ridge. In about another hour I gained
the summit, and was greeted with a faint cooey,
probably from the party we had seen. I could not
see them nor make them hear, so made my way
down with all reasonable speed, hoping to overtake
them. When I reached the lowest gendarme&mdash;the
one with a deep narrow fissure&mdash;a sudden mist hid
everything from view. It was impossible to see the
way off; and while I was trying various routes a
snowstorm and cold wind drove me to seek shelter
on the lee-side of the rocks. There, tied on with my
rope, and still further secured by an ice-axe wedged
firmly in front of me, I was forced to remain until
mid-day on Tuesday. Then the mist cleared, and,
climbing very carefully down the snow-covered rocks
I reached the snow arête, where most of the steps
had to be re-cut. The next serious difficulty was
the lower part of the Wandfluh; I could not remember
the way off, and spent two or three hours in
futile efforts before I found a series of chimneys on
the extreme right, leading down to the glacier. The
sun set when I was on the high bank of moraine on
the Zmutt Glacier, and in the growing darkness it
was far from easy to keep the path. The light in
the Staffel Alp inn was a guide as long as it lasted,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlii">xlii</span>
but it went out early, and, keeping too low down, I
passed the inn without seeing it, and being forced to
stop by the nature of the ground, spent the night
by the side of the torrent. It was late in the morning
when I awoke, and then a scramble of a few
minutes brought me to the path, near the sign-post,
and I reached Zermatt at half-past eleven.’</p>

<p>Mr. Hill’s escape is one of the most wonderful in
the history of mountaineering. His endurance and
courage are not less remarkable. To have been out
alone, in bad weather, without anything to eat save
five raisins, and with nothing to drink but ice and
snow, on a difficult and dangerous mountain, and to
have returned safely is, I believe, a record in climbing
annals. I may add a few details, given me by Mr.
Hill when I first met him after the accident, which
he has not reproduced in the above narrative.</p>

<p>He thinks his companions were killed instantaneously.
They uttered no sound; they made no
apparent attempt to save themselves. With arms
outspread they rolled helplessly down the awful face
of the mountain. He watched them for a few
seconds, powerless to help, if help would indeed have
availed, and then turned from the sickening sight.</p>

<p>During the last part of his descent, even his
great strength began to fail. Once, on the Wandfluh,
he lost his axe and had to spend an hour in climbing
down to recover it, as it was absolutely essential
to his safety. After he left the Zmutt glacier in
darkness, he appears to have become delirious. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliii">xliii</span>
was constantly talking to imaginary companions.
He fell into holes in the ground and went to sleep
without strength to rise. He wakened from cold,
called to his companions to go on as it was time to
be leaving, stumbled, and fell asleep again.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning Dr. Sumpner arrived,
having travelled straight through from Birmingham
to Evolena. Friends tramped down from Arolla,
others had come from Zermatt, the secretary of
Jones’s section of the Swiss Alpine Club came from
near Neuchâtel. A carriage bore Jones’s plain black
coffin, with a gilt cross on it, down from Haudères.
We buried him and the Evolena guide, Vuignier, in
the little graveyard of the Roman Catholic church,
almost in sight of the glorious, but terrible, mountain
on which they met their fate. The scene in the
village almost baffles description. All the villagers,
men and women, attended the funeral, clad in coarse
white robes. The grief of the women, especially of
Vuignier’s poor old mother, was heart-rending to
witness. The little Roman Catholic chapel was
crowded, the congregation all in white, save the
acolytes, two village boys, who served the altar in
their coarse brown, everyday clothes, and the choir,
whose strong voices rang through the whitewashed,
humble building. A little knot of Englishmen, sunbrowned,
of another faith or of no faith at all, joined
in the impressive and solemn service. It was a sight
that no one present can ever forget.</p>

<p>After the service, we bore the two coffins to the
graveyard. Rev. Mr. Scott, the Anglican chaplain,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliv">xliv</span>
read the English burial service over Owen Jones’s
grave. Mr. Hill sent a beautiful wreath of edelweiss
and the foliage of the Alpine rose. A rude wooden
cross marked the spot till Jones’s friends erected
a suitable gravestone. The lovely warm sunshine
and the bright blue sky, and the gleaming snows on
the slopes of the Dent Blanche, formed a curious
contrast to the mourning of the village in that
Alpine valley.</p>

<p>Thus perished, as he would, I doubt not, like
to have died, Owen Glynne Jones, a brave and
dashing mountaineer, a cheery and kindly friend,
whose presence will be long missed by all who
had the privilege of knowing him. His death was
due to a pure accident, occurring when he was in
the plenitude of his powers, and when he seemed
just about to reap the reward of long years of
patient, ardent toil.</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Some eight years ago chance led me to the Lake
District for the first time, and a kindly acquaintance
whom I then met at Wastdale taught me something
of the joys of rock-climbing. Since that occasion
every holiday has been spent on the mountains,
either in Cumberland or North Wales or Switzerland,
and they have taught me much that is worth knowing
and that when once learnt can never be forgotten.
Men with the highest literary qualifications have
written of the charm of mountaineering, and every
aspect of the subject has been touched upon with
fullest justice and with a grace of style that has
captivated many a non-climber in spite of his prejudices.
Yet I cannot refrain from adding my own
humble tribute of praise to the sport that has done
so much for me and my best friends.</p>

<p>It satisfies many needs; the love of the beautiful
in nature; the desire to exert oneself physically,
which with strong men is a passionate craving that
must find satisfaction somehow or other; the joy of
conquest without any woe to the conquered; the
prospect of continual increase in one’s skill, and the
hope that this skill may partially neutralize the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_l">l</span>
failing in strength that comes with advancing age or
ill-health.</p>

<p>Hunting and fishing enthral many men, but
mountaineering does not claim the sacrifice of beasts
and fishes. Cricket and football are magnificent
sports, and it is a perpetual satisfaction that the
British races are becoming enthusiastic in their
appreciation of keen contests in these games. Yet
there is something repulsive in the spectacle of five
thousand inactive spectators of a struggling twenty-two,
and the knowledge that the main interest of
many players and observers is of a monetary character
does not tend to convince one of the moral benefits
that these sports can offer. On the other hand, it is
scarcely fair to judge a sport by those who degrade
it in this manner, and we all know that genuine
cricketers and footballers play for love and honour.</p>

<p>The mountaineer does not reap any golden
harvest by his exertions&mdash;even if he writes a book
on his subject. He does not exhibit his skill to
applauding thousands; and his vanity is rarely
tickled by the praise of many. He must be content
with the sport itself and what it offers him
directly.</p>

<p>Probably the scientific mountaineer gains most.
He is certain to acquire rare and valuable knowledge
of facts in zoology, botany, or geology, if he starts
with the necessary intellectual equipment. The
physicist’s mind is perpetually exercised by the
natural phenomena he witnesses; mist bows, Brocken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_li">li</span>
spectres, frost haloes, electrical discharges of the
queerest description, mirages, all these offer him
problems of the most interesting kind. But the fact
is, there is so much to do that is directly connected
with the climbing itself that the natural sciences are
usually left to themselves, and their consideration
reserved for special expeditions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, science can often assist the
climbing. The engineer can triumph with applications
of the rope. He can tell us some facts worth
knowing on the value of friction as an aid to stability,
on the use of an axe as a support or as a lever, or on
the safe methods of negotiating loose stones. The
man who knows something of geology is a useful
member of an exploring party; he is often able to
guess correctly where available passages occur in a
wilderness of rock, and can judge at a distance what
quality of climbing the party may expect. The
expert in mountain weather does not exist; perhaps
he does not dare to, or perhaps the subject is too
complicated for a nineteenth-century scientist. However
this may be, it is worth while paying a little
attention to meteorology and noting the quality of
weather that follows any definite condition of the
wind, the barometer, or the atmospheric temperature.</p>

<p>The causes that have resulted in the publication
of this little book are as difficult to define as those
that produce a rainy day in the Alps; and, now that
the book is written and nothing remains but an
introduction, I wish that the reverse order of proceeding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lii">lii</span>
had been adopted, and that the introduction
had been written as a peg on which succeeding
chapters might have been definitely hung.</p>

<p>From the outset the illustrations have been
regarded as the chief feature of the book, and it was
my good fortune early to obtain the co-operation of
Messrs. G. P. Abraham &amp; Sons in the production
of good photographs of the most interesting pieces of
rock scenery that the Lake District affords. Messrs.
George and Ashley Abraham have accompanied me
on several climbing excursions with the express
purpose of obtaining artistic and yet accurate photographs
of the main difficulties that beset the cragsman’s
course, and I am bound to add that they are
as skilful in tackling severe pitches as they are in
taking successful pictures. The practical troubles in
manipulating heavy photographic apparatus where
most people find work enough in looking solely to
their own safety, the frequent impossibility of finding
a sufficient contrast in light and shade among the
crag recesses, and the subsequent difficulties in
development of such awkward subjects, will convince
the reader that theirs has been no light task, and at
the same time will offer sufficient excuse for certain
small defects that we have been unable to eliminate
from the photo-mechanical reproductions. These are
in collotype on platino-surface paper which shows
the fine texture of the rock structures.</p>

<p>For the benefit more particularly of climbers
several outline diagrams have been introduced to
explain the outlines of those more important crags
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_liii">liii</span>
up each of which many different routes have been
found, lines of ascent that cannot be readily recognised
in the photographs themselves, and that cannot
be briefly described in words. Some of these are
purely diagrammatic, where it has been found impossible
to base them on good general views. The
others are outlined from photographs, and can in
most cases be compared directly with the corresponding
views from which they are derived.</p>

<p>With the knowledge that I was getting substantial
aid in the illustrative portion of the book, the
management of the rest has been much simplified.
There are very many people who come regularly to
the English Lake District to ramble about on the
fells and to make the ordinary ascents. Of these, by
far the greater number steer clear of the precipices
and other steep parts, wisely recognising the danger
that attends the inexperienced in such places. Nevertheless,
they enjoy the mountains and are charmed
with the scenery. They do not know much about
the innermost recesses of even their favourite peaks.
To many of them Mr. Haskett Smith’s little book on
‘Climbing in England’ must have been a revelation;
for it indicates with sufficient clearness that every
crag in the country of any considerable dimensions
has been explored with wonderful thoroughness by
Alpine climbers, and that these abrupt walls and
gloomy gullies are the happy hunting-ground of many
an enterprising athlete. If my accounts of the
different ascents were briefly stated in the orthodox
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_liv">liv</span>
climbing-guide form, the book could appeal to none
but the elect; only an athlete in excellent training
could digest such solid diet. If, on the other hand,
they were recorded in narrative form, with a little
expansion of detail where serious difficulties occurred
during the expeditions, the book might at the same
time appeal to many a tourist who loves the country
and who likes to learn more about it. The latter
course has been adopted, and it is sincerely to be
hoped that the succeeding chapters will interest
such tourists.</p>

<p>There was another and more important consideration
which helped to decide on the form actually
taken. Our Alpine climbers of the highest rank are
born, not made. But most of the others, taking with
them some natural aptitude and plenty of money, are
made abroad. Why do they not take their preliminary
training for a year or two in Wales, or
Cumberland, or on the Scottish hills? It would be
much wiser and cheaper to support the ‘home
industry’ so far as it goes, before making their <i>débuts</i>
on the high Alps. Our British hills can give them
no glacier practice, but they can learn a vast deal
concerning rock-climbing before they leave the
country. To such as these the book is primarily
dedicated. There are no professional guides in
Cumberland who know anything about the rocks.
The amateur must come out and manage for himself.
But it is here intended to show that the Cumberland
school is a well-graded one; that the novice can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lv">lv</span>
start with the easiest and safest of expeditions, and
can work his way up to a standard of skill comparing
favourably with that of the average Swiss guide.
There is nothing so instructive as guideless climbing,
be it ever so humble in character. It makes the man
wonderfully critical when taken in hand by guides
later on, and renders him also much more able to
profit by their practical instruction.</p>

<p>For such beginners, the mere statement of the
position of a gully and the number and character
of its chief obstacles would be quite useless. He
requires something more; a suggestion here and
there of the manner in which the troubles can be
avoided or overcome, and a comparison of these
difficulties with others. It is natural that every man
has his own way of employing the limbs; my way of
dealing with a pitch might not at all suit another
climber, who perhaps relies less upon balance and
more on strength of arm than myself, or <i>vice versâ</i>.
It is therefore unwise to appear dogmatic in describing
methods, and I hasten to assure those knowing
critics that I have never meant to appear so. And
yet it is none the less a definite object throughout to
render the accounts in sufficient detail for those who
want assistance in repeating the ascents. I have not
hesitated to draw on old experiences, gained when
the ground was comparatively new to me; for there
is a tendency to depreciate, or indeed to overlook
entirely, the difficulties in any familiar route after
constant practice has removed those elements that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lvi">lvi</span>
introduce risk or uncertainty of success, and a novice
can often explain to a novice far more effectively
than an expert.</p>

<p>The Lake District is becoming more popular every
year as a centre of operations for cragsmen. Yet
there is no corresponding development of a set of
professional guides out there, though I believe they
would thrive exceedingly, and all stock information
about the mountains is confined to a few manuscript
books, and to Mr. Haskett Smith’s little publication
already referred to. The new comer is continually
at a loss for details; he has no means of learning
what is difficult or easy, how to circumvent dangerous
obstacles or to discover the safe points of attacking
them; he is dependent for such facts on chance
acquaintances made in the country or on correspondence
more or less painfully elicited from authorities.
When unsuccessful in these ways he is sometimes
tempted to launch out on his own account and wrest
the information from the mountains themselves.
This heroic method is undoubtedly the most effective,
but it involves too much risk for the unpractised hand,
and the wonder is that so few serious casualties occur
in its application. Such accidents do occur through
ignorance of the district, and always will so long as
the necessary knowledge that gives safety to the
explorer is confined to the few.</p>

<p>Mr. Haskett Smith’s book serves in the fullest
manner to indicate where good scrambling can be
obtained, to define the few technical terms in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lvii">lvii</span>
cragsman’s vocabulary, and to give general advice
concerning the best centres. It has been of the
greatest use to the climbing fraternity, who owe
their thanks to him. But he gives no detail of the
scrambling itself. He has appealed more particularly
to the expert, who can manage all his pioneering for
himself. Notably is this the case with the Pillar
Rock&mdash;practically his own particular preserve&mdash;where
most of the routes have long since been made
out by him. For years he knew the Rock as no one
else knew it; every chimney and ridge and wall was
within his ken. Yet in his little handbook there is
scarcely an indication of the possession of all this
unique knowledge. Most climbers expected some
expansion in the description of his early explorations;
but he has kept rigidly to his scheme of treatment,
and dealt but scant justice to himself throughout the
work. This book, then, is to be regarded in some
sense as supplementary in character, the cordial
witness of the good sport obtainable by following his
advice and general directions.</p>

<p>There are many men who think well of the sport,
but speak slightingly of the narrow field offered for
it by the Lake District. No doubt the Alps offer
far more scope both in range and quality. But we
cannot very conveniently reach Switzerland at every
season of the year. At Christmas and Easter it is
entirely barred to most people. The expense of
foreign travel is a consideration, and the question of
length of holiday is rarely negligible. Cumberland
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lviii">lviii</span>
can be reached in a night from London; the district
is an inexpensive one for tourists. The fact that
there are hundreds of climbs at our disposal in the
Alps is no great inducement in itself; we can never
climb more than one or two at a time, and for most
of us there will always remain scores of ascents that
we shall never have the opportunity of accomplishing.
One can learn how to swim as effectively in a swimming-bath
six feet deep as in an ocean; and one can
gain an extensive and practical acquaintance with
rock-climbing in a district where the whole set of
climbs can be accomplished by the expert in a few
short holidays, as in a country where the choice is
unlimited. Personally I should always go to the
high Alps when the chance offered itself, but Cumberland
serves remarkably well to allay the desire for
mountain air and vigorous exercise when Switzerland
is out of the question.</p>

<p>What does it matter that a climb has been done
before? Climatic conditions and the members of
one’s party introduce sufficient variety. Years ago
an expert reporter was trying to teach me shorthand.
His method was to induce me to copy out
the same report again and again; it was an excellent
idea, and the system was well vindicated with apter
pupils. Likewise in climbing, an apt pupil will
learn rapidly by repetition of the same ascents.</p>

<p>This introduces a point on which I am scarcely
qualified to speak, that of physical aptitude on the
part of the would-be climber. Mr. Clinton Dent in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lix">lix</span>
Badminton volume bestows a chapter on the subject
of ‘Mountaineering and Health.’ Here we have an
authoritative summary of the physical qualifications
required by the mountaineer, and of the bodily ailments
he may possibly incur. A perusal of the
chapter will convince the reader of the suitability of
a mountainous region such as our own country can
offer for preliminary training before the high Alps
are approached. There is much less likelihood of
over-strain; snow-blindness, frost-bite, and mountain
sickness are rarely met with here.</p>

<p>Climbers are absolutely incapable of any sustained
effort when they reach certain altitudes, and
the limit depends on the individual. It is the misfortune
of some to feel an uncomfortable perturbation
of the heart when once a definite level is passed.
They are well enough able to exert themselves below
that level, but can hope for no pleasurable exercise
above it. With every desire to climb, with muscle
and mind enough to excel in the sport, they are
nevertheless debarred from enjoying the high Alps.
Let them therefore make the best of our British hills
for a while, and then perhaps proceed to the
Dolomites in the Austrian Tyrol for fuller applications
at a safe low level of what they have here
learnt.</p>

<p>Solitary scrambling is universally condemned.
Most climbers of experience have learnt something
about it, and are unanimous in their unfavourable
judgment. Nothing teaches the scrambler so quickly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lx">lx</span>
if his nerve is sufficiently strong; but the penalty
paid for slight mistakes is often extreme, and the
risk is too great for him to be justified in deliberately
choosing the single-handed venture. A party of two
makes the strongest combination for most of the
ordinary Cumberland climbs; three are generally
better for the severest courses. Any beyond that
number will to a greater or less extent increase
the difficulty of the ascent and the time spent in
effecting it.</p>

<p>A rough classification is here appended of over
a hundred well-known courses judged under good
conditions. They are divided into four sets. The
first are easy and adapted for beginners, the second
set are moderately stiff, those of the third set
rank as the difficult climbs of the district, and the
last are of exceptional severity. Some attempt has
been made to arrange them in their order of difficulty,
the hardest ones coming last; but the variations of
condition of each due to wind, temperature, rain,
snow, or ice are so extensive that no particular
value should be attached to the sequence. But even
if only approximately correct, the lists may help
men in deciding for themselves where to draw the
line that shall limit their own unaided performances.
As for the items in the fourth class, they are best left
alone. Mark the well-known words of an expert
(Mr. C. Pilkington): ‘The novice must on no account
attempt them. He may console himself with the
reflection that most of these fancy bits of rock-work
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxi">lxi</span>
are not mountaineering proper, and by remembering
that those who first explored these routes, or rather
created them, were not only brilliant rock gymnasts
but experienced and capable cragsmen.’</p>

<p>In every expedition the party should be provided
with a sufficient length of rope&mdash;varying from twenty
to fifty feet for two men, thirty to eighty feet for
three&mdash;according to the character of the climb and
the lengths of its individual pitches. It is very
unwise to dispense with the rope, even on simple
courses; the fact is patent in the Alps that amateurs
take a long time to learn how to look after their
portion of the rope when busily engaged on rocks;
they are apt to leave all such details to the guides in
front or behind them, and would do well to practise
regular independence in that respect.</p>

<p>Ice-axes are generally necessary during the colder
months of the year. They are inconvenient to
manipulate on very difficult rocks, whether the
climber is going up or down. But in the rapid
descent of easy crags, face outwards, they are invaluable
as aids to balancing; and steep grass or
scree can undoubtedly be descended better with
their assistance. The Cumberland crags are too
smooth to make <i>scarpetti</i> (<i>Kletterschuhe</i>) worth trying.
These are rope-soled shoes that grip better
than nailed boots when the texture of the rock-surface
is sufficiently rough, but our expeditions are
best made without them.

<span class="large"><i>PIKE’S CRAG</i></span></h2>

<p>The Pikes of Scawfell are bold and picturesque,
but their precipices are slight and climbers can
find but little on them that needs the use of a
rope. One genuine exception must be made in
favour of Pike’s Crag, the rock that guards the
Pikes end of Mickledore. Here a good deal of
practice may be obtained, and although in comparison
with Scawfell Crag over the way we may
feel that everything is in miniature, yet the quality
of the work is good and some of the pitches really
severe. Few people seem to have troubled to
examine the detail of the cliff until September, 1894,
when Messrs. Fowler and Wilberforce spent a few
days on it, and prepared the effective diagram of the
lines of route that they subsequently transferred to
the Wastdale book.</p>

<p>The crag is visible from the road near the head of
Wastwater, and its three chimneys show up as black
recesses of inviting steepness and difficulty. These
retain their interesting appearance all along the walk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
up Brown Tongue, and it is surprising that at Hollow
Stones everybody turns off to the right towards Deep
Ghyll, when straight ahead they cannot but observe
the opportunity for novelty that Pike’s Crag can
offer them.</p>

<p>Between the Pulpit rock that overlooks the
Mickledore screes and the main mass of the Pikes is
a little <i>col</i> or neck that can be reached with ease from
either side. A gully runs up to it behind the Pulpit
from the Mickledore screes, with no difficulties whatever
to obstruct the walker. Another (<small>D</small>) leads to
the same spot from the Lingmell side, starting near
the foot of the great buttress of the Horse and Man
rock, and boasting of two pitches. Between <small>D</small> and a
scree gully well away to the left lie the three chimneys,
<small>A</small>, <small>B</small>, and <small>C</small>, and the best climbing of these
crags is here concentrated.</p>

<p>It is true that we can get some pleasant scrambling
up the outside of the Pulpit. A grass gully shows
well in the illustration, close to the right-hand edge
of the picture. The square tower of rock to which
its left branch leads overlooks the <small>D</small> gully and offers
fair sport. There are probably a few interesting
problems in the short gullies leading from <small>D</small> towards
the Horse and Man ridge. But to cover the best
ground in a single expedition I can recommend the
ascent of <small>A</small> and descent by <small>C</small>, then the direct climb
up the right branch of <small>B</small> and a return down the two
pitches in the <small>D</small> gully. Such was an afternoon’s
work that I was advised to undertake when inquiring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
of those who knew best how to gain a general knowledge
of Pike’s Crag. My companion was unacquainted
with Lake District climbing; it was his first
day in Wastdale, and during our walk homewards,
after following as rigidly as we could the directions
given us, he was reluctantly compelled to admit
that Cumberland climbing had good points that he
had never hitherto attributed to it.</p>

<p>We bore up from Hollow Stones directly towards
the <small>A</small> chimney, over a good deal of rough ground and
an occasional snowslope. It is the longest climb of
the three, and the hand-and-foot work commenced at
once. A block at the bottom, some fifteen feet in
height, was turned by a vertical crack on the left, with
excellent holds on the side wall. An easier way is by
the right, up a series of steep, wet, and mossy ledges.
This block was crowned by long tufted grass, and more
moss in the bed of the gully indicated clearly that we
were not on a much frequented route to Scawfell
Pikes. A few feet higher we noticed a grass terrace
stretching across the face of the crags to the right.
There proved to be several such terraces on the same
buttress between us and the <small>B</small> chimney, and we
concluded that it would be possible to climb up from
one to the other and so avoid the chimneys altogether.
Soon our route became steeper and careful clambering
was necessary. The gully was narrow and its walls
smooth, and no chance of further side-exit was open
to us. Then came the first genuine pitch, in three
portions of increasing severity, though the hardest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
is not in any way difficult or dangerous. We worked
first over a small boulder, then a bigger one followed,
and we were brought to a standstill at the entrance
of a narrow cave. We decided in favour of the right
wall, which showed good holds up near the level of
the roof. It looked a bad bit to surmount, but when
once the right leg of the climber had been swung on
to a sloping ledge on the wall, it was only needful to
edge along towards the jammed boulder and step off
into the bed of the gully again. The whole pitch is
about thirty feet high. Walking up the scree that
now presented itself, we were rather disagreeably
impressed by the appearance of the second pitch that
confronted us. It was a mossy wall about ten feet
high, and water streaming down it gave us but little
hope of continuing the climbing beyond it with dry
garments. Nevertheless the reality was not so objectionable.
The wall stretched from side to side of the
gully and offered many routes up. Taking a course
to the right of the middle, we found small footholds
beneath the moss that gave the chance of using the
fingers and toes only. Clammy embracing we
avoided, and our satisfaction on reaching the top was
altogether disproportionate to the actual difficulty we
had overcome, and will be unappreciated by those
who tackle the gully in drier weather. It seems to be
still better to work up the left corner.</p>

<p>Forty feet higher we could see the third and last
pitch. The gully is now very much more open. We
made a digression on the right again, and peered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
inquisitively down the hole at the top of the <small>B</small>
chimney&mdash;the hole that was said to discriminate
nicely between a thin man and a thick. The buttress
was considerably broken about here, and offered admirable
scrambling of a heterogeneous description;
but we had yet one more stage in our own direct
course, and returned to finish it. Several boulders
had combined to form another cave, whose interior
appeared to be rather complicated&mdash;judging by the
number of times I knocked my head in exploring its
upper regions. We tried hard to force a route up the
right wall, but after twenty minutes had been wasted
in futile attempts we decided to take the regulation
route to the left, and leave the variation for another
day that might find us there with an ice-axe.
The left wall is sufficiently provided with holds to
make the climb easy; but at the top there were
several stones to be passed that report said were in a
shaky condition. We were not troubled by them,
and after passing over, a glance at the screes that
remained above gave assurance that the presence or
absence of a few loose stones at the head of the pitch
would be quite fortuitous.</p>

<p>After a short halt called for photographic purposes
we made for the head of the <small>C</small> gully, the next
to the west that actually reaches the sky-line when
viewed from below. It was nearly all scree at a steep
angle, and we had good reason to be thankful that
no exploring parties were further down. There were
two or three places passed in our descent where the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
craggy bed of the gully jutted out through the layer
of loose stones, and at such spots, though no actual
climbing was necessary, the danger of one man
bombarding the other with projectiles made us both
proceed with an excess of caution. The one difficulty
in the gully, which we were now preparing
to descend, is by far the finest looking pitch on
Pike’s Crag. A large boulder with square edges
roofs in a cavern thirty feet high; a stream of water
pouring down the gully spreads over the boulder, and
forms a thin curtain of spray stretching from side to
side of the cave entrance. The two walls of the
gully are black and glistening, the floor of the cave
is slippery, and slopes steeply down to the foot of the
ghyll. The only safe way up or down the pitch is
by a series of ledges in a square recess on the left,
well marked in the opposite illustration.</p>

<p>We were ignorant of the character of the climbing
here, but there was no resisting the conclusion
forced upon us by a peep over the edge of the pitch,
that the recess on our right offered us the only
chance of descent. The ledges were tufted with
thick grass that now and again threatened to give
way. But on the whole we felt very safe, and when
the actual corner of the recess was reached, the
difficulties vanished and we had a simple traverse
back towards the waterfall. The descent of six or
eight feet to the foot of the fall was partially under
the spray, but haste on such slippery ground was out
of the question, and we moved one at a time with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
solemn indifference to the damping influences around
us, that might have argued a whole day’s previous
exposure and the absence of a vestige of dry
clothing. We had a steep slide down the snow
banked up at the foot of the gully, and then picked
a way across to the <small>B</small> chimney, the centre of the
series and the most attractive.</p>

<p class="caption">THE PIKE’S CRAG GULLIES</p></div>

<p><small>A</small> and <small>C</small> may be reasonably called easy. They
are not too hard for muscular novices, and are comparatively
safe. But the central chimney is decidedly
stiff, and should not be indiscriminately recommended
with the others. It is very narrow all the way to
the jammed stone at the top; it is about as difficult
to get out, when half-way up, as it is to continue the
direct ascent, and suitable belaying for the leader or
his followers cannot be found at the hardest parts of
the climb. I tried the chimney once when there was
a considerable quantity of water coming down, and
was compelled to give it up: it is probable that even
with a second man to help me I could not have
managed it.</p>

<p>We found our way safely to the entrance of our
chimney and started up. Almost immediately we
passed the branch gully on the left. It looks very formidable,
and indeed its first pitch is undoubtedly hard.
It consists of a two-storied cave, the first floor composed
of three jammed stones, which are passed by
backing up the crack and traversing outwards. The
second pitch is of a simpler character, consisting of
a cave that can be passed on either side. We had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
no designs on this variation, and were contented to
throw a casual glance towards the lower obstacle as
we proceeded up the rocky bed of our central
chimney. Our field of view soon became very
limited, for the clean-cut parallel walls on either side
were scarcely five feet apart, and the average slope
of the gully exceeded forty-five degrees. During the
first hundred feet the work was distinctly safe and
easy, but a glance backward at the point whence we
had started, seemingly the first stop in the event of
our falling, made us both inclined to imagine dangers
in our way. The side walls in intense gloom formed
a fitting frame to the narrow picture of the distant
sunlit fells. The general aspect of the situation
closely resembled that of the upper half of Collier’s
climb on Scawfell, and of the Oblique Chimney on
Gable Crag, though in each of those cases the chimney
is at a considerable angle to the vertical, whereas here
the fissure in the rocks is almost perpendicular. We
were a little perplexed by some ice that had frozen
in large rounded knobs to a thickness of eight or ten
inches over a steep six feet of the gully. An axe
would have summarily disposed of any icicles of
doubtful security, but we had not expected any such
evidences of cold and were unprovided. The ice was
not absolutely continuous; here and there we could
kick out levels for our feet, and to our relief the
trouble was passed in a few minutes. Then came
the worst bit of the ascent&mdash;the scene of my discomfiture
eighteen months before. First came a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
vertical wall stretching across the gully, and rising
twenty feet above our somewhat insecure standing.
Beyond that the gully sloped evenly to the dark
recesses of a cave, the jammed boulder of which
almost appeared vertically above our heads. We
mounted an upright block at the foot of the wall,
and prospected for holds. None were visible. I
peered at the sides in search of scratches, which
would show whether the earlier party or parties had
backed up the chimney. No! they had not availed
themselves of that process. Then, with the conviction
that an indirect way must exist, we examined
the walls a few feet below the pitch, and at last hit
upon a way of mounting higher. I was belayed by
a rope passing round the upright block already
referred to, and proceeded to walk along the horizontal
edge of a thin crack on the right wall, leaning
across to the other side of the gully for general
support on the hands. I had implicit trust in the
rope and the man at the other end of it, or the
manœuvre would have given me agonies of apprehension.
Just as the second step was being made
along the crack, its thin edge broke away under my
foot and I slipped a few feet down the gully, till the
rope tightened and brought me to a stop. A second
attempt was more successful. The edge was followed
till it expanded into a respectable foothold, and then,
holding myself straight, I was able to reach good
ledges for the hands. It was now easy to stride
across to the left wall and climb directly upwards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
along its crest to a platform large enough for both
of us; hither my companion followed me, adopting
almost the same tactics and taking but half the time.
We were now virtually out of the gully, and found
the sunshine pleasant after so much darkness. But
the joy that might have attended our remaining
efforts in working up to the head of the chimney was
marred by the reflection that we had not conquered
the chief difficulty; we had only avoided it. This is
right and proper for snow-climbers, but distinctly
unorthodox for cragsmen. Our doubts grew as we
advanced, and at last I proposed to descend again
and settle them finally. This suggestion was met
with a very prompt approval, and ten minutes later
found me at the foot of the vertical wall again. It
did not look any easier, and I am not prepared to
say how narrowly I missed a second failure. After
leaving the upright block the scanty holds soon disappeared,
and with some desperate struggling I
found myself backing up the chimney with the feet
thrust hard against the left wall. Both sides seemed
dangerously smooth, but cautious wriggling for a
distance of two or three feet brought a handhold
within reach, and the top of the wall was gained.
The only other ascent known to me was by a man
with a singularly long reach, and in some marvellous
way he managed to climb the wall without any
backing up.</p>

<p>Thence to the cave was fairly easy after a few
mossy loose stones had been flung down, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
finish was effected by a neat little ledge along the
left wall, passing out just at the edge of the pitch.
The hole through the cave is not so small as the
first investigators imagined; the trouble in passing
through is due to its crookedness, but the name of
the chimney is generally supposed to indicate with
proper remoteness the garment that is here threatened
with a complete inversion.</p>

<p>We hurried across the top of <small>C</small> gully and round
the Horse and Man to the Pulpit rock. The <small>D</small> gully
had a great deal of snow in it, and we indulged in
sundry glissades. The snow was not too hard nor
the angle too great, otherwise ice-axes would have
been necessary. The upper pitch was passed on our
left with perfect ease. Then further snow led to
the lower pitch, a much more imposing sight. Two
sharp-edged boulders of immense size formed a cave.
On the side of the Pulpit rock there seemed to be no
chance of passing it. The other side, though mossy,
might easily be made to go. In our descent we kept
a little further away, and came down ledge after ledge
with excellent holds to the foot of the pitch. Then
more glissading brought us down to the open fell
again. We spent a quarter of an hour watching
with much interest a party coming down Scawfell
Pinnacle by Steep Ghyll, and having seen them safely
into the lower part of the ghyll, where the steady
click of the leader’s axe intimated slow progress over
ice-covered rocks, we turned our backs to the fell
and moved leisurely homewards.

<span class="large"><i>DEEP GHYLL. THE GREAT CHIMNEY AND
PROFESSOR’S CHIMNEY</i></span></h2>

<p><span class="large2">Deep Ghyll.</span>&mdash;This will remain for long a
favourite resort of climbers, partly because the two
pitches are always interesting and may be turned in so
many different ways, partly because the gully gathers
annually a big snow drift, which can generally be relied
upon between Christmas and Easter to afford some
practice in the use of the ice-axe, and partly because
the rock scenery is of the finest character throughout.
The ghyll has been familiar to the visitors of Scawfell
for many years. It was first ascended in March,
1886, by Messrs. Geoffrey Hastings and Slingsby, and
an interesting account of the expedition appeared in
the ‘Alpine Journal.’ It had been descended twice
before, in 1882, by Messrs. Mumm and King, with
heavy snow blocking the pitches, and in 1884 by Mr.
Haskett Smith. The quickest way of reaching the foot
of the ghyll is to walk up Brown Tongue till within a
couple of hundred feet of the level of Hollow Stones.
It is here unnecessary to keep straight over towards
the centre of Mickledore, for a shallow depression
to the right of Brown Tongue may be traversed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
obliquely upwards, and the scree struck close to the
well-defined edge of the lower crags of Scawfell.
Thence it is best to keep close under the cliffs, following
an easy gradient up to the Lord’s Rake. This is
the large scree gully passing up to the right, under
the main mass of Scawfell. The scree forms at the
foot of the Lord’s Rake the usual fan-shaped talus,
which here stretches down towards Hollow Stones.
In summer it may occasionally be worth while
making directly up the centre of the scree.</p>

<p class="caption">DEEP GHYLL, FIRST PITCH</p></div>

<p>Just opposite the corner round which one turns
into the Lord’s Rake a rather slightly marked gully
starts up from the side of the rake. It becomes better
defined a few yards higher, and leads directly into
Steep Ghyll. Almost at the same spot a ledge is to be
noticed passing round to the left of the huge wall
fronting us at this corner. This is the start of the
Rake’s Progress, the happy name given to the well-known
terrace leading to Mickledore. We shall
have further occasion to allude to this ledge, but we
now pass up the Lord’s Rake till in a few feet we
come to a magnificent gully on our left, recognizable
under any conditions except the most snowy by the
cave at its foot. A fine View of Deep Ghyll and its
surroundings may be obtained by scrambling up to
the low ridge that faces us as we look outwards from
the cave. The ridge is somewhat broken up, and the
terrible accident that caused the death of Professor
Milnes Marshall at this spot must be a warning to
any who wander up without thought of danger.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>The orthodox route up the first pitch in Deep
Ghyll is by the cave and chimney. It is the
most interesting way, and probably in dry clean
weather it is the easiest. When the chimney is
cased with ice the route may become impossible.
In that case a recess in the right wall (right, of
course, when looking up at the climb) is often taken
as a winter emergency exit; for although the holds
are slight in summer, loose stones well bound up
make it quite feasible in frosty weather.</p>

<p>The hardest way up the pitch is by the thin cleft
between the big boulder and the left wall.</p>

<p>Passing up for about 150 feet we find a steep
slope of rock occupying the left half of the gully.
The scree in the other half leads up into a cave
whose black rectangular aperture may have been
observed from the Lord’s Rake ridge. The cave is
formed by the ubiquitous jammed boulder, and no
through route can be effected. A thin chimney cuts
between the rock slope and the huge vertical left
wall that rises with scarcely a break to the Low Man
on the Scawfell Pinnacle. This chimney constitutes
the easiest and safest route over the second pitch.
On the right face an irregular ledge leads to a larger
chimney (Robinson’s), which with some trouble can be
followed till a level about twenty feet above the top
of the cave pitch is reached. Thence a small terrace
offers an easy promenade to the upper bed of the
gully. A third way of taking the difficulty has been
found; indeed, it is the most obvious way, though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
much the hardest. It is to climb the left wall of
the cave entrance, and then wriggle up between the
rock slope and the cave boulder.</p>

<p>There are many pleasant reminiscences of parties
in Deep Ghyll. The hardest struggle I ever had
with the first pitch was on Christmas Day, 1897.
The rocks were badly glazed, and though we had no
trouble in penetrating to the inmost recesses of the
cave, we could find no easy way of getting higher.
We were loth to try, seeing that one of our party
had, with a mistaken philanthropy, loaded his rücksack
with preserved fruit, prunes, and Carlsbad
plums, and proceeded forthwith to dignify our primitive
lunch with these unwonted luxuries. A halt
called to consume a beef sandwich may be quickly
terminated&mdash;and that, moreover, without a sense
of sorrow, unless the beef is very bad&mdash;but those
who know Carlsbad plums will realise how easily we
were demoralised by their seductiveness, and how
much we preferred to sit in our cave and argue on
complicated topics with the plum-box open. But
the owner was a man of some resolution, and
heroically vowed that we should see no more of the
plums till we reached a small recess at the top of
Moss Ghyll, where we should ensconce ourselves after
climbing the gully. So we made a start at once.
The back way out of the cave promised well at first.
It showed no trace of ice, but on emerging from the
chimney (at the spot where the lower figure is shown
in the View facing p. 12), and looking straight down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
to the entrance of the cave, it was found that a
thin sheet of ice covered all the rocks. Generally
speaking it would be better to let the rocks alone on
such an occasion&mdash;in fact always, unless Carlsbad
plums are at stake. Then, perhaps, the second man
may be held firmly by the rope from behind while
he gives the leader a shoulder. This help is of no
use unless the leader can venture to trust the icy
handhold above him, by which he is to swing round
the awkward corner to the right. Some such scheme
our party devised, after many futile attempts to fix
an axe firmly as a foothold, and the leader dragged
himself up the glazed surface to the deep snow
above. In the ordinary state of things, be it
remembered that where the climber emerges from
the hole, he has first to stride round to a small ledge
on the right. He can use as a take-off the rough
surface of the boulder, and can reach a rigid
handhold of small dimensions but good shape.
Thence to the top of the pitch is easy scrambling,
though care is needed.</p>

<p>The snow in the gully was in grand condition
for kicking steps, and after the last man had been
brought up the pitch in safety we marched to the
upper cave and discussed the question of route over
the second pitch. The direct way was ruled out of
court at once, for its largest ledges are but half an
inch wide, and ice on these rendered them useless.
With a keen recollection of our trouble down below,
we thought of the Robinson Chimney on the right,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
which is quitted by crossing on to a slabby rock that
slopes down towards the centre of the gully. With
ice on this an attempt to force the way up would more
likely find us shooting over to the foot of the cave.
Such a finish to our little day would no doubt
exactly coincide with the anticipations of our more
sanguine relatives and friends, but for the moment
we had to consider each other’s feelings and I
suggested the easy way up. There was a smiling
unanimity of agreement in the party which pleased
me far, very far more than a hundred strictly
impossible ascents. We descended the gully again
to the foot of the rock slope, and rounded into the
little chimney. Things went very well for a few
feet. But as we rose the ice became more troublesome,
until it was necessary to chip it away from
each diminutive ledge, and to proceed upwards with
the utmost caution. The first part finished with a
little snow patch twenty feet above the top of the cave
boulder and the bed of the ghyll. Some years
before, when first I visited Deep Ghyll, we had found
it impossible to climb directly upwards from this
point, and a man was let down by the rope into the
ghyll. He cut steps up until he had obtained a
higher level than the others waiting, and then
induced them to traverse out a bit and jump into
the snow below. The process was possible only
with a long rope. Here we could all rest and contemplate
the rock slab opposite which finishes the
Robinson Chimney. Forty or fifty feet higher we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
could see, well marked out by the snow, the upper
traverse that enables a careful walker to pass up
Deep Ghyll without any hand-and-foot work. It is
readily accessible from the Lord’s Rake, a few feet
higher than the ordinary entrance to Deep Ghyll,
and leads at an easy angle to a point in the main
gully some hundred feet above the second pitch.</p>

<p>Looking up at the left wall of the Ghyll we could
see that our slender chimney was but the beginning
of a long crack that cut obliquely into the wall, and
curled upwards in a fine sweep of eighty feet
towards the summit of the Low Man. The curtain
of rock that closed in the crack on its right hand
made our next few yards rather troublesome, for it
encroached on our ledge and rendered the work too
open. Facework is always more trying than chimney
climbing, especially when ice is about. But the
leader’s recollection of the ease with which this part
could be overcome in summer time divested it of all
its fancied terrors and perhaps of some of its real
dangers, and he had therefore a better time of it than
his companions, whose extremities were somewhat
benumbed by their patient waiting in awkward
places, and whose activities were confined to their
vivid imaginations. All actual danger was over
when a horizontal ledge was reached well above the
centre-level of the gully, which we followed with
ease to the broken rocks that almost form a third
pitch for Deep Ghyll.</p>

<p>Here the pleasantest way of finishing the day
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
was to cut steps in the snow up the central gully,
the angle gradually steepening from 35° to 55° at
the top. That way we therefore took, and were soon
enjoying the plums. But a rise of a few feet will
show the Professor’s Chimney immediately to the left,
cutting deeply into the rock between the Scawfell
Pinnacle on the left and Pisgah on the right, and
terminating at a fine-looking notch, ‘The Jordan,’
in the sky-line. Exactly opposite, on the right-hand
side of the ghyll, is the Great Chimney, a black
and formidable square-walled recess crowned by a
jammed boulder. This was for a long time regarded
as impossible and scarcely ever attacked, but at last
it yielded to the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blake
and Southall, and has since shown itself to be very
amenable when approached with due precaution.</p>

<p><i>First pitch, New route.</i>&mdash;The Christmas Day of
1896 was very windy and cold. Our party had fought
continually against the weather all the way to Deep
Ghyll, and inasmuch as we had only the previous day
arrived at Wastdale our limbs were scarcely fit for
such a desperate grind. I had the pleasurable
responsibility of guiding a lady, Mrs. H., who had
been persuaded to accompany her husband on a
winter excursion. We had a great deal of very soft
snow to get through on our way up, and I was looking
forward to a long halt in the lower cave, where
we should at least be protected from the wind
and snow. Great was our distress when we
found the entrance completely blocked up by a huge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
drift. It must have been fully twenty feet deep
in front of the cave, and the prospect was most disheartening.
In disgust I clambered up the wall
immediately to the right of the boulder, and at last
managed to reach the aperture leading into the cave
from above. It was festooned with huge icicles, and
at first the entrance looked effectually blocked.
Smashing down the ice with the energy of despair,
the tremendous clatter suggesting to my friends that
of a bull in a hardware shop, I discovered that the
chimney was only iced at its entrance, and that the
upper storey of the cave could be reached. Some
of the others quickly followed, and we found ourselves
in a spacious chamber into which the great heap of
snow had scarcely encroached. This was delightful.
We threw ourselves into the drift that blocked the
main entrance, and cut away at it with vigour till at
last we had tunnelled through to the daylight. The
biggest man of the party yet remained outside and we
persuaded him to insert his legs into the aperture.
Without giving him time to change his mind we seized
his boots and hauled hard. For one dread moment
we thought him jammed for ever, but immediately
afterwards we found ourselves lying on our backs
in the cave with a yawning opening in the snow-drift,
the while our massive friend measured his
diminished circumference with a loop of rope. The
others then came in and made themselves at home on
ropes, ice-axes, and other people’s cameras. We were
a party of ten, large enough to be a merry one.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Our surroundings were weird and savage, unlike the
British notions for a Christmas Day, but I remember
that we behaved like civilized people in perhaps one
respect. We discussed the year’s literature. Fancy
Troglodytes discussing ‘Trilby’! Then it occurred
to us that our feet were very cold, and that we
should not have much daylight for climbing if we
waited longer. Our intention had been to climb
Deep Ghyll in two separate parties, by the ordinary
way. But the drift suggested a trial of the crack up
the left-hand side of the first pitch. The snow would
serve as a high take-off, and also a good cushion to
soften the fall if the leader were destined to fail.
The first difficulty was to get safely into the crack;
then it was found that the holds were very scarce,
and the recess somewhat too constricted to allow any
bracing across from one side to the other.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">SCAWFELL PINNACLE AND THE PROFESSOR’S CHIMNEY</p>
</div>

<p>Think of a foothold; double it. Put your whole
weight on to it as you straighten out. Take away
the hold you thought of, and you will find yourself
wondering how you got there. In some such
vague way are very bad bits climbed, and while
gasping for breath at the top the climber usually
feels that it was the worst place he has ever been in.
Seriously, however, this route is severe at all times.
In summer the drift is absent, but with rocks slightly
wet, as they usually are in that corner, the effort of
working upwards is extreme. It is probably best to
keep one’s back to the boulder all the way up.</p>

<p>My section of the party came up first. We were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
very cold, and some fear that Mrs. H. would have
frost-bite prompted us to change our minds concerning
Deep Ghyll, and to traverse away to the left
towards the foot of Steep Ghyll. The others came
up the pitch by our route, led in good style by
Mr. H. V. Reade. They expressed regret at our
untimely departure, and worked laboriously up the
ghyll. It was ungenerous of us that evening to gloat
over the fact that they had had a terribly cold time
of it higher up.</p>

<p>Our route out of the ghyll was known to Mr. Haskett
Smith in 1882. It is not often used, and, indeed,
in winter it offers certain risks of its own. Starting
from the top of the pitch we bore directly down towards
the entrance to Lord’s Rake, and when within a
reasonable distance of the snow, jumped down to it,
sinking in up to our necks. Hurrying down to
Hollow Stones as fast as our limbs would carry us,
we endured the pangs of returning circulation in our
hands and feet, and finished the descent in exhilaration,
and with a sense of having well earned our
share of the Christmas festivities.</p>

<p><i>Second pitch, Variety routes.</i>&mdash;A description of
the direct way over the second pitch is scarcely
necessary. The leader must start just at the entrance
to the cave, and work up the corner to the
recess between the jammed stone and the cave
boulder. The holds are minute, and the necessary
stress on the finger tips excessive. He should try it
first when there is snow below him, and with his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
second arranged to pay out twenty feet of rope from
the innermost corner of the cave. If the leader is
destined to slip, it will take place at the point where
the slope suddenly becomes easier, for then his fingers
are fatigued, his centre of gravity wants for the
first time an onward as well as an upward motion, and
his foothold will fail him at the crisis. Therefore his
centre of gravity will describe the ordinary parabola
back into the snow, and the tremendous jerk on the
rope will make the man wonder whether the remains
of his centre of gravity are worth retaining. Supposing
that he has safely rounded this awkward
edge, the utmost caution is necessary for six feet till
the scree is reached. Then comes the trouble of
manipulating the rope without shaking down stones
on the next man who is to pass up. If the leader
wants the rope to be in actual tension on his
account, he has a hard task in bracing himself
firmly without dislodging the scree from under his
feet. This trouble of course is minimised when good
firm snow can be cut to supply him a footing.</p>

<p>On the whole this direct route over the second pitch
may be regarded as too risky, except under the best
possible circumstances&mdash;such, for example, as existed
when Messrs. Robinson and Creak found the two
pitches in Deep Ghyll entirely covered with snow, and
an easy route available straight up the middle from
bottom to top. Then there was no second pitch!</p>

<p>The chimney on the right is excellent, but is not
a course open to beginners. It is in two parts. At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
the two places where it must be quitted the route
lies up the buttress on the left. I recall the remark
of an unenterprising follower as he looked up at the
vertical walls above him; he had been in difficulty
down below and was inquiring my intentions. His
patience had been all but exhausted, and he said so,
adding: ‘It is not merely steep parts that so upset
me. They can be borne, but I don’t like this infernal
dangling.’ The discussion was diverted into a side
issue, as to whether the adjective was permissible, but
in justice to his memory&mdash;he never visited the Lakes
again&mdash;be it said that very few climbers like the
sensation of suspense.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Great Chimney.</span>&mdash;The position of this has
already been defined. Its ascent affords the best
finish to the Deep Ghyll climb if snow is absent from
the gully and the screes are wearisome. The aspect
of the chimney is most forbidding from below, and
there is probably but one way of vanquishing it. I
had been told how the first party had proceeded
up it, and had also heard an account of their
defeat at a second attempt. There is much likelihood
of defeat even when one knows the way, by
reason of the awkwardness of the corner that needs
careful negotiation, and I am bound to admit that a
first ascent rapidly accomplished may help the climber
very little in his second attempt. At the time of my
visit the rocks were warm and dry, our party of three
had just come up Collier’s Climb, and were keen on
completing their knowledge of Scawfell by making
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
for the only chimney with which they were unacquainted.
We all gathered together high up in the
recess, and then, when the rope had been satisfactorily
arranged for a long run out, I started working up the
right wall by some small but strong ledges till the
roof of the cavern was approached. Then it became
necessary to work out of the cave and round by the
jammed stone. Just outside was a ledge within
reach for the hands; but to work the body up the
corner so as to kneel on the ledge was very awkward,
the main trouble arising from the depressing effect of
the corner of the jammed stone which forced head
and shoulders almost to the level of one’s feet. The
prayerful attitude realized, I could anchor myself a
little by looping the rope round a stone in the roof
and had then only to stand up and clamber between
the boulder and the living rock, trusting to footholds
on the latter. A few feet landed me in safety and the
others came up like smoke, carrying my cap that the
gymnastics round the corner had shaken down to them.
A short scree and a few easy rocks completed the
gully, which both in regard to the aspect from above
and to the form of its one great difficulty reminded us
of the Shamrock Gully over in Ennerdale. The main
differences in these two pitches are that the Shamrock
Gully pitch looks easier but proves to be harder, also
that it has less cave and more boulder. Neither
pitch is suitable for beginners.</p>

<p>By walking across to the foot of the lower part
of Professor’s Chimney&mdash;a name, by the way, given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
first to the easy exit on the right of Pisgah&mdash;a pitch
of some severity can be taken or left, as fancy
dictates. The platform above this pitch leads well
into the chimney and the climb again gets stiff. A
direct ascent of the pinnacle is probably feasible
from this level, but the first thirty feet will need
the utmost enterprise on the part of the daring
aspirant to fresh honours in this well-explored
region.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Professor’s Chimney.</span>&mdash;This looks
almost as difficult as the Great Chimney opposite, but
is more a test of style than skill, the only trouble
being that of loose rocks. Though unworthy of
perfect confidence at all times, it may become most
friendly in times of frost; many loose stones occur
that can be safely <i>pressed</i> though dangerous to <i>pull</i>,
so that with a slight modification of style they are
rendered highly useful. Then of course two loose
stones may share one’s weight when one cannot
take it.</p>

<p>The introduction of all this elementary practical
mountaineering is due to my recollection of a huge
stone that came away near the top of the Professor’s
Chimney when my party were coming up it. I was
out of harm’s way on the Jordan above, but in
wrestling with the last part of the chimney, a portion
that slightly overhangs, the second in the party pulled
away the rock. It bounded down, ricochetting from
side to side, and for a moment placed the startled
climbers in imminent peril.

<p>In conclusion, just a word to pedestrians who
have come out to climb only by telescope. The
ascent of Scawfell from the Lord’s Rake may be
safely and rapidly accomplished by following its lead
past the entrance to Deep Ghyll.</p>

<p>The best plan is to keep as straight a course on
the scree as the up-and-down nature of the Rake
will permit, with the steep rocks immediately on the
left. A pinnacle is almost at once passed on the
right that in former times was oft mistaken by the
unlearned for the great Scawfell Pinnacle, more
especially because a cairn had been erected on its
crest as a decoy, by the wily discoverer of the true
pinnacle. Then it becomes necessary to descend a
little, taking care not to slither down to the right
with the loose <i>debris</i>. After a few yards the slope
again rises for a while, and an easy gully shortly
discloses itself on the left, following which the tourist
will find himself in a few minutes on the stony
plateau that at an easy inclination travels away
westward to Burnmoor. In clear weather he will see
the huge cairn that crowns the top of Scawfell, at a
slight elevation above the top of the gully, and can
safely make a bee-line for it. Climbers often descend
by this route in bad weather when the Broad Stand
appears to elude their anxious search.</p>

<p>The quickest way down from Scawfell is to make
for the head of this gully, and then, instead of
descending, leave it on the right and follow the edge
of cliff straight towards the head of Wastwater;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
where the edge is deflected to the left, a scree-run
to the foot of Brown Tongue takes us over rough
but safe ground to the diminutive footpath that
starts at the stone wall. It should be learnt first in
clear weather, if possible, as there is no royal road
to safety for the befogged novice on the fells.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="large"><i>THE RAKE’S PROGRESS AND CERTAIN SHORT
CLIMBS NEAR IT</i></span></h2>

<p><span class="large2">The Rake’s Progress.</span>&mdash;This happy title dates
from about 1881. The Progress is an easy ledge
leading from the lower end of the Lord’s Rake to the
point where the Mickledore ridge joins the main mass
of Scawfell. It runs along the base of the vertical
walls of this mountain, and though at a great elevation
above the huge Mickledore hollow, is scarcely entitled
to the thrilling adjective <i>vertigineuse</i> of the French
climbing vocabulary. Yet it is capable of carrying
one into the finest situations; and even the hardened
expert, with his steady head and well-trained muscles,
realises while on it that danger is hovering about him
at every step, though it does not touch him. Years
ago I read, in Freshfield’s ‘Italian Alps,’ of the Pelmo
traverse in the Ampezzo Dolomites, and memory
seized on the Rake’s Progress as the nearest approach
to it that mountain experience had then afforded. Let
there be no rise on the Mickledore; make the Progress
thrice as long, and a little more rakish; change
the rock from porphyry to magnesian limestone; let
the drop below the ledge be a few hundred feet instead
of a few score; make it necessary to crawl on all fours
in one or two corners, and the resemblance will be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
perfect! In a few yards after the preliminary scramble
on to the ledge, the crags are broken on our right
by the short chimney entrances to Steep Ghyll and
Moss Ghyll. These cannot be mistaken, inasmuch
as they mark the last possible points of attack on
these cliffs for one-half of the traverse.</p>

<p>Passing the entrance to Moss Ghyll, to which we
must return for the ascent of this fine gully, a steep
rise marks the accomplishment of one-third of the
course. A little further a thin cleft cuts obliquely
up the cliff towards the left. It is wonderfully
straight, and the slabs of rock on either side are
hopelessly smooth. The crack widens higher up, but
until 1897 the terrific simplicity of its lower portion
had warned off all who examined it with the view
of storming this side of Scawfell. The upper half,
reached by an ingenious zig-zag route on the face, is
now well known as one of the safest and best climbs
on Scawfell. Shortly afterwards we reach a rectangular
recess looking as though it had been quarried
for a gigantic monolith. Here again the great
difficulty of starting up is manifested at a glance,
though in the same direction up above the recess is
so much more deeply cut and the sides so much
nearer to each other that one’s safety is assured for the
second half of the climb. In this case also, the middle
is reached by a slight detour on the left. A few yards
further along the Progress are two thin cracks uniting
at a height of twenty feet and leading to a platform
ten feet higher. Thence a perfectly safe cleft passes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
directly up for another forty feet, till a grassy
ledge, clearly visible only when marked by snow,
takes one easily to the middle of the long chimney.
To mount the chimney is an undertaking well
within the powers of the average rock-climber, and
with the additional merit of being perfectly safe for
a party of three.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Ascent of the Broad Stand</span></p>

<p class="small">(<i>Face page 30</i>)</p></div>

<p>Such are the Keswick Brothers’ Climb and
Collier’s Climb, two of the best conceived problems
of the district and worthy of their discoverers. The
lower half of the latter is undeniably severe; even
the best have failed at it, and I propose in a
separate section to describe an ascent in detail, to
point out the method our party adopted to eliminate
the risk that the climber is popularly supposed to
accept as inevitable, and to indicate how the Keswick
Brothers’ route enables us to avoid the worst
piece altogether.</p>

<p>The next halt we make close to the Mickledore,
within thirty-five feet of the end of the Progress.
Here a thin cleft, known as Petty’s Rift for the last
twenty years, leads to a square recess ten feet up, and
marks the start of the North or Penrith Climb up the
Scawfell crags. These are now only a few score feet
above us. The illustration facing page 26 shows how
the upper outline of the cliff and the Mickledore
ridge approach to within a few feet of each other.</p>

<p>Having reached the Mickledore ridge it is well
worth while walking along it to its furthest end, and
then bearing to the left on to the Pulpit rock, for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
sake of the fine view of the climbs we have just been
enumerating. The Eskdale side of Scawfell is terminated
by an abrupt vertical cliff that seemingly offers
no sort of route for the cragsman. Half way down
to the corner of this cliff, a gully cuts deeply into
the mountain, and passes upwards at an apparent
angle of 45° towards the tops of Moss Ghyll and
Collier’s Climb.</p>

<p>The gully&mdash;Scawfell Chimney or Mickledore
Chimney, as it is sometimes distinctively called&mdash;has
its own peculiar difficulties in wet or snowy weather,
but when at its best it may be attacked by comparatively
inexperienced men, if they are properly
equipped and exercise ordinary precautions. On the
other hand, the gully represents the drainage channel
for a considerable area, and is usually wet.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the easiest way from Mickledore up
to the ridge facing us is by the Broad Stand. The
start is made in the cleft half way between Mickledore
and the foot of Scawfell Chimney. Three short
pitches, each less than ten feet, take us on to an easy
slope that can be followed to the upper part of the
chimney. To keep up between the chimney on our
left and the steep cliffs to our right is an easy matter
in clear weather, till Pisgah appears on our right,
the descent into Deep Ghyll straight in front of us,
and the cairn-crowned summit of the mountain a
hundred yards away towards the left.</p>

<p>This finishes the preliminary survey of the eastern
face of Scawfell, during the perusal of which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
reader is recommended to examine the diagram
facing page 46.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Broad Stand.</span>&mdash;My first climb in the Lake
District was up the Broad Stand. Dr. S. and I had
planned a week’s walking tour over the Cumberland
fells, guided by Baddeley and Jenkinson, and ignorant
of the existence of any regular rock practice
hereabouts. We walked up from Langdale one
Sunday morning in heavy snow to the top of Rossett
Ghyll, and then studied the guide book for information
concerning the small tarn that lay a few feet beneath
us. ‘Deep and clear, and good for bathing,’ we read;
so we bathed. It was long ago, and neither of us
has bathed during a snowstorm since. Our feet got
benumbed standing on the snow while we were
dressing ourselves, and we had much ado to restore
circulation. Then as the day advanced and the air
cleared a little, it seemed possible that we might find
a way up Scawfell Pikes, which, we had read, was
the highest point in England. With much ploughing
through soft snow, loaded with heavy knapsacks,
and supported by but one broken walking stick, we
reached the topmost cairn in perfect safety and
realised the height of that Easter ambition. Then it
was that Dr. S. read aloud to me a thrilling description
of the Mickledore chasm, which presented an
almost impassable barrier between the Pikes and
Scawfell, a terrific gap that only hardy cragsmen of
the dales were able to traverse. The ice-cold bath
on that Sabbath morn had done much to quench
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
our spirit, but we had partially recovered ourselves,
and a burning desire to scale the majestic peak
opposite flamed up in each of us simultaneously, and
drove us down towards the Pulpit rock that sentinels
the Mickledore. The guide-book was not wanting
in detail. There were three Ways of attacking
Scawfell from Mickledore; first the Chimney, then
Broad Stand, and then the Lord’s Rake. I believe
we guessed the position of the chimney correctly, for
after all there is something to show for the name;
but we were hopelessly at sea with the other two.
Dr. S. argued that Lord’s Rake sounded so much
worse than Broad Stand that we were bound to go
for it wherever it might be and however easy its
aspect. Nobody at home would believe us if we described
a Broad Stand as a vertical wall hundreds of
feet in height, glistening with ice, and guarded above
by overhanging boulders ready to pulverise the bold
invader. On the other hand, the Lord’s Rake seemed
remotely to suggest Jacob’s Ladder, and offered the
imagination a goodly choice of adjective and epithet.
Where, then, was the Lord’s Rake? We had little
time to consider, and rapidly decided that the Broad
Stand was away down in Eskdale on the left, and the
Lord’s Rake straight up from Mickledore. Wherein
we were wrong, as the previous pages may show the
reader. Then we tried to get up the wall just where
the Mickledore ridge strikes the cliff, but the cold soon
drove us to seek some easier start lower on the left.
Thus it was that fate took us to the actual Broad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
Stand, up which, inexperienced though we were, we
could scarcely help finding the correct route. Place
a man at the right starting point, and he will easily
find the upward line of least resistance, though not so
swiftly as he would trace out the downward line if
he slipped.</p>

<p>Twelve yards down from the Mickledore we
came to a deep recess in the mountain side, large
enough to penetrate if one is not burdened with
a knapsack. (A confirmation of the right spot is
supplied by a thinner crack six feet lower down
the screes.) Wriggling up into the recess and then
out on to the slightly sloping platform above it was
a matter of only a few seconds, and we then found
facing us a wall of from eight to ten feet in height
offering very little hand or foothold for a direct
attack. But by descending the sloping grassy ledge
at its foot we could see some iced ledges (clear rocks
show the marks of many boots) that suggested the
circumvention of the difficulty. To these we in turn
trusted ourselves, and by passing round the somewhat
awkward left-hand corner of the wall we found
an easy though steep route to its flat top. Then a
smaller wall of about seven feet barred the way. It
was easier than the last, though in those days the
frost had not scooped out the hollow on the edge,
and by the help of my comrade’s shoulders I reached
the summit. The difficulties were obviously over;
we could walk up by the right on to the snow slope,
above which, as our early inspection from the Pulpit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
rock showed, there was an easy route to the top of
Scawfell. Unfortunately my friend was not up the
last step. I could not reciprocate his kindness and
offer him my shoulders. We had no rope, and the
rocks were all glazed. I had not intended to mention
our ropeless condition, but the truth will out sooner
or later; neither had we nails in our boots. But
apparently we had sense enough to realize that an
accident might happen if we tempted Providence
any further, and with some sorrow we decided to
descend again. We found our way down the Mickledore
screes and Brown Tongue to Wastdale, and there
learnt that we had tried conclusions with the Broad
Stand at its worst. We also learnt that from the top
of the third step which I had reached the route lay
up the snow slope to the broken rocks, then slightly
to the left until the easy part of the chimney could
be looked into, then obliquely up to the right over
rough ground to the small cairn overlooking Deep
Ghyll. Many times since then, rattling down the
Broad Stand when the rocks were dry and our party
well acquainted with every inch of the ground, have
we recalled that Easter Sunday and our first essay of
the Broad Stand. There have also been many occasions
to remember the golden rule in the descent of
these crags. First find the top of the Scawfell Chimney;
keep it on the right till its one pitch is just
below. Then bear to the left down the grassy slope
and hunt for the notch in the top step of the Broad
Stand.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>The usual thing in a fog is to find oneself down
in Eskdale. I remember a photographic friend once
leaving his camera at the foot of Deep Ghyll while
he went for an hour’s round of Lord’s Rake, Scawfell
Cairn, and the Broad Stand. The dense mountain
mists gathered about him at the top, and rendered
useless his efforts to steer the true course. That night
he discovered himself at Boot, and three days
elapsed before he found his camera, suffering from the
effects of over-exposure as much as himself.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The North Climb.</span>&mdash;This starts at Petty’s
Rift, already referred to on page 31, about twelve
yards from Mickledore along the Rake’s Progress.
From a distance it looks as though the climb would
necessarily include the funnel-shaped gully below the
Progress, and the whole aspect of the work is somewhat
forbidding. Nevertheless the difficulties are
concentrated in the first six feet. When once the
climber can get a foot on to the floor of the little
square recess, his safety is assured. In the photograph
facing page 40 the positions of the three members of
the party indicate sufficiently well the course usually
taken. The last man is taking off with his left foot,
and has his right hand at the edge of the recess on
to which he intends to climb. The face is very exposed
in wintry weather, and several stories are told
of parties who have suffered here from frostbite. It is
not a safe place to descend when ice is about the rocks.</p>

<p>The following account of the North or Penrith
Climb is taken from Mr. C. N. Williamson’s article in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
‘All the Year Round.’ Introducing, as it does, Mr.
Seatree’s original description, I make no apology for
quoting it in full: ‘There is yet another and a more
direct way of climbing the Scawfell cliffs from Mickledore,
which, for want of a better name, we may christen
the “North Climb.” The route is known to very
few. It was discovered for himself in 1874 by Mr.
George Seatree.... Major Cundill had already
climbed it in 1869.</p>

<p>‘From the ridge we traversed a ledge of grass-covered
rock (the Rake’s Progress) to the right until
we reached a detached boulder, stepping upon which
we were enabled to get handhold of a crevice six or
seven feet from where we stood. To draw ourselves
up so as to get our feet upon this was the difficulty.
There is only one small foothold in that distance,
and to have slipped here would have precipitated
the climber many feet below. Having succeeded in
gaining this foothold, we found ourselves in a small
rectangular recess with barely room to turn round.
From here it was necessary to draw ourselves carefully
over two other ledges into a small rift in the
rocks, and then traverse on our hands and knees
another narrow ledge of almost eight feet to the left,
which brought us nearly in a line with the Mickledore
ridge. From here all was comparatively smooth
sailing.</p>

<p>‘The detached boulder may be identified with
certainty by noticing that it is imbedded in the
Rake’s Progress close to the top of a funnel-shaped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
grassy gully about ten or twelve yards from Mickledore.
None but experienced climbers should
attempt the North Climb from the Mickledore.’</p>

<p><span class="large2">Scawfell Chimney.</span>&mdash;A year after our first
sorry attempt on Broad Stand Dr. S. and I were being
shown the merits of Cust’s gully on Great End as a
school for step-cutting, by an enthusiastic wielder of
the ice-axe, Mr. C. G. Monro. Neither of us knew
much about the subject, but it was pleasant to be well
instructed, and on reaching the summit of Great End
we wondered where we could cut steps next.
Monro suggested an adjournment for lunch at
Mickledore and a subsequent passage up the doubtless
snow-filled chimney: to which we all agreed.</p>

<p>On reaching the chimney, Monro took the lead
and hopefully ploughed through heavy wet snow as
a preliminary. Unfortunately, the snow became
softer and deeper as we advanced, until at last we
were up to our waists in slush, and wet through.
The pitch was not very far to seek. We saw long
dripping icicles barring our direct route onwards.
Both sides of the gully were heavily glazed with wet
ice, and we foresaw an anxious time of waiting while
the leader prospected. At the time we were not aware
that the usual exit was upon the right-hand side of
the pitch, by a couple of easy broad ledges. Nor
could we see that the pitch was in two parts, cave
upon cave, with a large resting-place between; for
the icicles hung in an impenetrable curtain. Monro
attacked the icicles valiantly. Twice he succeeded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
in working half way up between the centre and left
wall, but twice he was repulsed vigorously, and
found himself landed in the snow below. I was
getting cold and impatient. Monro was willing to
take a breathing space. I unroped and made for
the left wall. Cutting little steps for hands and feet
in the ice that covered the wall, and using the fingers
for all they were worth, in some ungainly fashion I
reached the level of the top of the pitch and
traversed on to the snow above. The axe had been
used, I suspect, more like a croquet mallet than anything
else, and introduced its own particular dangers.
But it was of no consequence, the pitch was climbed,
and the shivering pair below tried to fling up the
rope to me. This was a matter of much difficulty,
placed as we were, but by approaching each other
as far as we dared, a happy fling brought the end of
the rope to my hand, and I responded by throwing
down, to their extreme peril, the ice-axe that they
needed to effect their ascent. We managed the rest
badly. My position was insecure in the upper snow
of the gully, or at any rate it seemed to be so. The
others were benumbed with cold and wet, unable to
feel the holds or to rely on getting any help from me.
We certainly were not a strong party, and there was
no possibility of mutual aid. The only consolation
was in the fact that all danger was absent; a fall
could only result in a plunge into ten feet of soft
snow, but we never afterwards spoke with pride of
that afternoon’s work. The other two decided to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
give it up, and go down to Mickledore again. My
own feelings were not consulted, but what matter?
The Broad Stand was somewhere about. I might
descend that way and shout when in trouble. We
joined again at Mickledore, and rather gloomily
glissaded to Hollow Stones.</p>

<p class="caption">THE PENRITH CLIMB FROM MICKLEDORE</p></div>

<p>That evening at Wastdale we hunted out Williamson’s
reference to the Scawfell Chimney. ‘It is
impossible to get straight up the chimney, as the way
is blocked by an overhanging slab, and escape must
be effected either by the right-hand wall near the
top, where handhold is miserably inadequate, or by
the “corner,” forty feet up the chimney. The passage
of the corner is a matter of stride and balance, as
there is no positive hold for the hands. There is a
bad drop into the chimney behind, and a slip in
rounding the corner would end in broken limbs, if
not a battered skull. A man essaying the corner
must apply himself like a plaister to an unpleasantly
projecting rock, and then by shifting the weight
from one foot to the other (for the legs are stretched
widely apart) he can creep round.’</p>

<p>The chimney has not often been climbed by that
variation of mine since then. In dry weather it is
perfectly safe to ascend or descend direct by the
pitch. In the ascent both sides of the gully may be
used at first; then comes an awkward crawl over the
first jammed boulder, into the secondary cave. Then,
taking care of a few loose stones, another jammed
boulder forming the roof is overcome&mdash;it is only a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
few feet high&mdash;and a passage out on the right is made
possible. A long stretch of scree next fills the bed
of the gully, the right wall of which is here broken
away almost entirely, so that the climber generally
makes an exit, and passes straight up to the Deep
Ghyll cairn. But a pitch still remains to terminate
the scree, and must be climbed by him who would
assure himself of having explored the gully in its
entirety.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Parson’s Gully.</span>&mdash;An easy way of descending
to upper Eskdale other than by the Mickledore
route was pointed out a few years ago by the
Rev. T. C. V. Bastow. It is by a short gully with
two pitches, due south of the summit cairn. When
drift snow lies about it, it is generally possible to
walk or glissade down the whole length of the gully
on to the screes below.

<span class="large"><i>MOSS GHYLL, COLLIER’S CLIMB, AND
KESWICK BROTHERS’ CLIMB</i></span></h2>

<p><span class="large2">Moss Ghyll.</span>&mdash;There are accounts of explorations
of this famous gully as far back as 1889. It
was styled Sweep Ghyll by Mr. R. C. Gilson, partly
for euphonious grouping with Deep Ghyll and Steep
Ghyll, and partly as a suggestion of ‘the probable
profession of its future first climber.’ In June, 1889,
a strong set of four managed to penetrate upwards
into its recesses a yard or two beyond Tennis Court
ledge, 300 feet above the Rake’s Progress, and almost
exactly half way from start to finish. Here the
explorers saw the great jammed boulders apparently
barring all further progress, and decided to return
the way they came. Then, a few days later, another
party went round to the top of the gully and
descended to the lower edge of the small scree that
so quietly terminates the high and difficult last
chimney. Here they firmly anchored themselves,
and let down an adventurous member on 160 feet of
rope. He descended in this way as far as the upper
portion of the great obstacle in the middle of the
gully, but saw no way whatever for an ascending
party to circumvent or attack successfully the
immense barrier. He apparently realized that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
upper chimney could be fairly climbed, though of
course it would tax the resources of the best of
cragsmen; but the jammed boulders he judged
to be insuperable, and returned to tell his companions
the melancholy news. They left Moss
Ghyll with the conviction that it would never be
climbed, and until December, 1892, everyone else
who came and saw turned back with much the
same impression.</p>

<p>On the 27th of that month Messrs. Collie,
Hastings, and Robinson made a determined attack
on the ghyll. The winter was exceptionally fine and
the rocks were clean and dry. They easily reached
the Tennis Court ledge, and thence traversed into
the gully. Penetrating the cave below the big
pitch, Dr. Collie, who was leading, climbed up to
the roof and out by a small window between the
jammed boulders. Thence, by the ingenious expedient
of hacking at a thin undercut plate of rock,
he exposed a small foothold on the wall that enabled
him to traverse out from the pitch and into a place
of safety beyond. Thence to the top of the pitch
was an easy matter, and the remaining members of
the party quickly followed him. It has since been
discovered that the hardest part of the gully was
yet before them. They, however, had practically
solved the main problem, and were contented to
work out of the gully by steep ‘mantelshelf’
climbing up to the left. The honour of the first
strict ascent of Moss Ghyll fell to Dr. Collier a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
days later, who climbed the ghyll from beginning to
end under the impression that the previous party
had done the same. Dr. Collier was accompanied
by four others, and was emphatic in his opinion that
the final chimney represented the hardest part of
the climb. Two days later he took up Professors
Marshall and Dixon, and from the former I obtained
sufficient information to start off one morning on my
own account to learn for the first time what Moss
Ghyll was like.</p>

<p>It was distinctly a day of adventure, and I learnt
a great deal concerning the ghyll. The passage
across the Collie step appeared to me the most difficult,
but the loose slabs over which one has to walk
adroitly were then covered with fresh snow. The
famous step was invisible, and I had to stoop and
scrape in order to determine its exact shape and
position. At the first attempt on the traverse I
slipped, and fell into the snow-bed of the gully below.
The result was scarcely surprising, though eminently
uncomfortable. But the falling was, under
the circumstances, almost part of the programme,
and a rope had been fixed in the interior of the
cavern, passed out through the ‘window,’ and then
attached to my waist, to eliminate the danger of
plunging some 400 feet down to the foot of the
gully. The second attempt was successful, though I
confess to a feeling of lively apprehension as the
critical point was being passed.</p>

<p>Thence to the parting of the ways was easy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
travelling, and an exit was made by the left-hand
route. I returned two days after to fetch axe and
rope, that had been left at the big pitch, but it was
not until the Whitsuntide of 1896 that a suitable
opportunity occurred of visiting Moss Ghyll at its
best, for the purposes of comparison and of exploration
of the direct finish. During that interval the
climb had been repeated many times, and Moss
Ghyll was by way of becoming ‘an easy day for a
lady.’ Hot-headed youths would arrive fresh at
Wastdale, inquire for the hardest thing about, and
at the mention of Moss Ghyll would straightway fling
themselves into the breach and by hook or crook
wriggle themselves up and out in triumph. Others
were unsuccessful, and it was always amusing to
learn where the stupendous difficulty had arisen,
where no mortal man could have gone further. The
personal equation was always in evidence, both in
the actual climbing and in the history thereof.</p>

<p>My companions at Whitsuntide were Messrs. W.
Brigg and Greenwood. Neither of them had been
in the ghyll before, but both were very keen to make
its acquaintance, though so far as reading could take
them the smallest details of the climb were perfectly
well known. We separated off from a larger party on
the Rake’s Progress, and at the entrance to the gully,
which I have already defined in position, we roped
up and began the rock climbing at once. There are a
few small and stiff pitches that may be taken as they
come in the first fifty feet of ascent from the Progress;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
but we were quite willing to make the usual divergence
to the right from the entrance to the first cave. This
led us up easy grass and rock close to the gully,
which soon dwindled into utter insignificance by
reason of its right wall being almost entirely cut
away. Keeping out in the open until the slope
suddenly steepened, we made a traverse into the
gully, and walked up the screes until stopped by a
long and awkward-looking grass-crowned chimney.
Then we were hemmed in on both sides, and my friends
were invited to define the nature of the next move.
They knew something of the locality; we had to
climb up the right-hand wall on to a level platform
some eighteen feet higher, and then work back into
the ghyll by a slightly upward traverse. The platform
was the well-known Tennis Court ledge, and its
vertical wall was one of the chief difficulties of former
days. When in 1893 I had first occasion to climb
the wall, there was much ice about and it was easiest
to work some way up the chimney before stepping
out on to the wall. The second attempt, two days
later, was in worse circumstances, and I preferred
working directly upwards to a still higher level before
diverging. On that occasion it seemed as though
the simplest plan would have been to avoid the
Tennis Court ledge altogether and keep to the
chimney. But Mr. Kempson has since pointed out
that the grass holds at the top are unreliable except
when frost holds the earth together. With Brigg
and Greenwood I should have been loth to leave the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
Tennis Court unvisited. So we clambered directly
up to it. The holds in the lower part of the wall
were slight but very firm. The surface was rough
and reliable. Two-thirds of the way up we found a
little spike of rock that offered an admirable hold,
sufficient to belay the rope safely while rounding
the top edge of the wall and drawing up on to the
platform. The others then came up with ease, and
we halted a moment to look at the view.</p>

<p>The ledge is scarcely large enough for tennis, it
might be eight feet long and two or three feet wide;
the name is just the overflow of the pretty wit of
some early explorer. Above us rose threateningly the
vertical rampart that separates Moss Ghyll and Steep
Ghyll. We could see the jammed boulders a little
higher up in our ghyll. They appear small from
Hollow Stones, but from our ledge each looked
almost as large as a church. Wastdale Church we
had in mind. The opposite wall of the ghyll looked
hopelessly inaccessible, and we were little surprised
that so many before us had been content to look and
return. The traverse into the ghyll again was not so
easy. If the leader slipped it would require clever
management of the rope on the part of the others to
avoid an unwilling follow on, though I believe a
party was once tested here in that manner&mdash;and
survived the test.</p>

<p>It was necessary to pass round a small buttress on
to the scree bed of the gully. The first two steps
were upwards, with just a steadying hold above for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
the hands. It was not desirable to keep too high,
an unnecessary lengthening of the <i>mauvais pas</i> that
some climbers recommend. The footholds are not
perfect; they are large, but slope the wrong way.
When dry, the friction is ample to prevent slipping.
Where the rocks are glazed, as I have good occasion
to remember, the passage is distinctly dangerous,
especially the return from the gully to the Tennis
Court ledge.</p>

<p>Thence, when all had rounded the corner safely, we
walked up scree into the large cavern formed by the
two jammed boulders. The one would of itself have
formed a bridge across the gully, with a recess between
it and the steep bed of the gully; the other, which is
much larger, has fallen on to the first and roofed over
the recess. When well within the cave we could see
the ‘window’ high up between the two boulders, the
one weak point by which the pitch could be attacked.
I clambered up the interior of the cave and on to the
window-sill. One of the others followed me, the third
staying below to anchor the rope more firmly. From
the window we could see the smooth steep wall on
our right by which we were to traverse outwards. A
couple of feet below our level we could observe that
the rock formed a sharp horizontal edge six feet long,
below which it overhung considerably. Just along
this edge we were preparing to walk, using two steps
that were sufficiently large for our needs. The first
was the step cut by Dr. Collie. The second was at
the further end of the short promenade, and was just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
capable of holding the toes of both boots. Starting
with the right foot on the first step, the further end
of the second step was taken in a long stride with the
left. The right was then brought up to it, and the left
reached round the corner at the end on to a respectable
and satisfying foothold. The trick of balancing
was not very difficult, providing of course that the
body was kept as nearly as possible vertical. A tumble
when no snow was about would be painful even with
a rope to limit its freedom, so we moved with deliberation
and with a due sense of the difficulties of the
place. After passing the dreaded <i>pas-de-deux</i>, I
reached in about ten feet of ascent a satisfactory
recess, where a ‘belaying pin’ was to be found. It
is an excellent projection of rock, sometimes overlooked
by climbers, behind which the rope can be
slipped, and held with firmness in the event of a fall.
It is a little awkward for the leader to pass directly
up into the ghyll again before the second man moves
away from the window. Such a course would require
a long rope. Using the belaying pin we found that
a sixty-feet length of rope was ample for the party
of three, and no time was lost in unroping or re-adjusting.
When our second man reached the pin
I quitted the recess to make room for him, and
mounted into the gully while he played up the last
man. A few feet of easy scree brought us into the
large open portion of the ravine which marks the only
spot where it is possible to break away to the left
from the gully. The final crags in front rose abruptly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
up for another 200 feet, and were deeply cut by the
vertical Collier’s Chimney, which starts almost at
once from our level. The skyline trended downwards
by the left, so that the open route to the top was
not so long in point of distance as the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="small">(<i>Face page 51</i>)</p></div>

<p>It certainly was easier to work up the wall to the
left. It rose at a steep angle, and was columnar in
structure, with long, porphyritic slabs crowned by
small levels of tufted grass. The leader would often
be unable to help his followers with the rope, but the
successive ledges could be so chosen that no great
distance would exist between the resting-places.
Such open work is often more trying for the nerves
than harder chimney climbing, but it is always
admirable practice when the ledges are reliable.</p>

<p>I had quitted the gully by this variation three
years before, and wanted both on my own account
and that of my friends to work out the alternative
route. I started up the right wall, at first steadied
by the left, but soon found myself too far out of
the chimney to feel at all comfortable. Thirty feet
up was a jammed stone blocking the narrow way,
apparently very effectually. But we had heard of a
possible wriggle behind the jammed stone, and with
a reprehensible lack of daring I made a traverse to
the chimney again, and began working up it with
back and knee in the orthodox manner. The
situation was safe enough, but the effort of lifting
oneself inch by inch was supremely fatiguing, and
when I discovered the hole behind the boulder to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
about half my minimum sectional area I began to
regret the scheme. But it was too late to return, and
with a dread fear of closing up the ‘through’ route
for ever, I straightened out one arm above my head
and thrust it through the hole. Fortunately I had
no camera sack to hold me back, a frequent source of
annoyance in a tight place. Here we were all travelling
light, and I had nothing to thrust through the
aperture but a limp body that was at every moment
lessening its rigidity. As soon as both shoulders were
well in, the rest followed more easily by vigorous
prisings with the elbows, which are so useful in
upward thrusting. Dragging myself into a standing
position on the jammed boulder, I called on the
others to follow. They chose the outside course,
making two little détours out and back on the
vertical wall, probably the exact plan adopted by
Dr. Collier in the first ascent. My position in this
little ‘sentry-box’ was secure, and the rope could be
manipulated with all necessary care till the three
of us were gathered close together in the tiny recess.
Then we had a somewhat easier scramble up the
next vertical portion of the chimney, to pass some
small jammed stones twenty feet higher. We used
the same wall and found the footholds in it more
obviously arranged for our convenience. The first
climber had surely a bad time of it on this wall,
seeing that it was all moss-covered, and required an
immense amount of preliminary clearing before the
holds could be discerned. But moss has had no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
chance of growing there for the last four years, and
we had none to trouble us. A couple of minutes
carried us from the sentry-box to the top of the next
pitch. The slope of the ghyll suddenly became
easier, scree led to a short and easy rock pitch,
somewhat spoilt by loose stones, and then a walk to
the top brought us in contact with friends and the
commissariat.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Pisgah Buttress.</span>&mdash;In the second chapter
mention was made of the small pinnacle of Pisgah
that flanked the Professor’s Chimney. Viewing the
crags from Mickledore, it will be seen that this
pinnacle is the culminating point of the ridge
between Moss Ghyll and Steep Ghyll. It is
convenient to introduce here a brief account of
the first ascent of this ridge directly from the
‘Tennis Court.’ Messrs. G. and A. Abraham had
repeatedly assured me that their inspection from
neighbouring points of view had been favourable,
but it was not until April 22, 1898, when ascending
Scawfell Pinnacle by the Low Man, that I examined
the Pisgah ridge with the object of attacking it.
The same afternoon these two friends awaited my
arrival on the ‘Tennis Court.’ I came along the
Mickledore towards the Pulpit Rock to enjoy a rest
and the society of a party of friends, but was disappointed
of both by a call from the Ledge. In ten
minutes from the Mickledore I joined them, and
while recovering breath, was interested to hear of
their attempts to reach the Ledge by other ways
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
than Moss Ghyll. Then, disposing the rope properly,
we went to the extreme right corner and started the
real business. I had a vertical crack about twelve
feet high to surmount. It led to a small platform
similar to the one from which we began our climb, and
presented the usual difficulties&mdash;no hand or foothold.
A shoulder was given me, then probably a head, then
a steadying hand for my struggling feet, the left
arm being thrust well into the crack and the right
doing as best it could on the wall, until it could
reach the grassy edge of the platform above. Once
on this the prospect was pleasing, and we dubbed
the spot a ‘Fives Court.’ Thence a steep chimney
rose directly towards the ridge. I mounted some
twenty feet and debated whether the others
might safely come up and help. There seemed to
be a fair chance of entering an overhanging chimney
away up to my left, or of following the direct route
to the ridge. The first course attracted me a yard
or two along a narrow ledge, until the way was
barred by an immense poised block. It trembled as
I touched the horrible thing; so did my friends
down below, and they besought me to play the
straight game, and aim for the arête instead of
aiming at them. They were perfectly just in their
choice, and it is as well that their advice was followed,
for we should have had a terrible time
working the overhanging chimney. Ten or fifteen
feet of rather careful scrambling brought me to the
edge of the buttress, at a point where I could descend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
a little on the Steep Ghyll side and belay the others
with absolute security while they mounted.</p>

<p>The point we had reached was on a level with the
top of the Slingsby’s Chimney on the Pinnacle.
Another party of climbers were operating over there,
and gave us some useful information as to the work
we had above us. Our rock was not altogether firm
and reliable, so that the next bit of vertical ridge in
front was discarded in favour of a slight détour on
the left face. Belayed as he was by the others, the
leader ran very little risk, and employing a succession
of moderately firm, tufted ledges, he dragged himself
steadily up for another twenty feet before his
companions quitted their belay and joined him.
Then we unroped and walked up the remaining
hundred feet with no trouble whatever, astonished
to find that our difficulties had been so few and so
rapidly overcome. In an hour from the ‘Tennis
Court’ we were swinging down the Broad Stand
ledges.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Collier’s Climb</span>.&mdash;For many years it was
currently supposed that any attempt to scale the
precipice between the North Climb at Mickledore
and Steep Ghyll round by the Pinnacle, ranked the
daring enthusiast as one <i>quem Deus vult perdere</i>,
and, moreover, that the gods would not give him the
chance to finish his undertaking. But with the
advent of a greater number of experienced climbers,
coming to Wastdale with recollections of the stupendous
rocks in the Swiss Alps or the Austrian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
Dolomites, a reaction gradually set in. To many
nothing seemed impossible with a party of three and
an Alpine rope. But a line must be drawn somewhere
to separate the possible from the impossible,
and some try to draw it by their own experience.
These constitute what is called the ultra-gymnastic
school of climbing. Its members are generally young
and irresponsible. With years will come a desire to
depart this life in one piece, after the common joys
are realized that life is able to offer. The quick-burning
fever for wild adventure dies away with the
approach of workable theories of life. Whatever the
mental phenomenon may be, I am convinced that
the physical is vestigial&mdash;a trace of our former
savagery, a suggestion of the lively past, when the
struggle for existence involved more muscle than
mind.</p>

<p>Wherefore let live the ultra-gymnasts, if indeed
they can pass through their March-madness without
coming to grief; nor should we attempt to inoculate
them with some harmless sport, for the result is to
render the sport dangerous.</p>

<p>To return to the separating line that suggested
this digression. Those who have sought to define it
theoretically have been of the foolish ones, for it has
no absolute position for mankind. Each individual
possesses a line of his own, and at first in looking for
it he causes it to re-arrange itself. What was once
impossible for him becomes easy. But his search is
more rapid than its advance, and a time comes when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
he realizes that he is perilously near; and in
wisdom he vows evermore to keep at so many feet
or centimetres (according to his choice of units) from
its nearest point. The nearer he habituates himself
to approach, the oftener does he discover some
obvious retreat of his line. Those who live far from
it find that it can narrow its limits. Which things
are an allegory, for this line is a closed curve and
limits us in all directions, only one of which leads to
rock-climbing.</p>

<p>Our walk along the foot of the Scawfell wall by
the Rake’s Progress showed three breaks in the cliff
after we left Steep Ghyll. The first marked Moss
Ghyll, the second Keswick Brothers’ Climb, the
third Collier’s Climb. The history of Moss Ghyll
and its gradual yielding to the persistent attacks of
active parties has been recorded in the first section.
The news of its ascent came as a surprise to all who
knew the place, so great a surprise that no room was
left for wonderment when Dr. Collier a few months
later proved the practicability of his route. But
whereas Moss Ghyll became popular in a week by
reason of the writing-up it immediately received,
Collier’s Climb was almost untouched for three years.
The unknown is always the most terrible, and the
brief note in the Wastdale climbing book recording
its first ascent left much to an anxious imagination.
Queer tales were told round at the inn of men who
were flung back over the Rake’s Progress after rising
only ten feet. Even Dr. Collier was reported to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
have said he never wished to see the place again.
Report was inaccurate, but that made no difference.
I candidly admit that there seemed little chance of
ever getting up such an awful wall. It was not till
I found myself twenty feet up the crack that the
attack seemed in the least degree hopeful.</p>

<p>It was just after Easter in 1896 (April 22), and
my party had been climbing well on the Screes and
in Deep Ghyll. The rocks were in marvellously good
condition, perfectly dry and warm to the touch.
G. and A. were with me, their last day before returning
home. I thought it imprudent to take their votes,
and announced that we were going to look at the
first part of Collier’s Climb, and to ascertain where its
difficulty lay. Fortunately they were both sanguine,
and placed their heads and shoulders at my disposal
as footholds. We made straight for the right spot
in an hour and a half of easy going from Wastdale.
There could be no possible doubt of the place. A thin
crack rose direct from the Progress, overhanging
for the first ten feet, then leaning back a trifle
towards the left. A yard or two to the left of this
a square corner led directly up so as to join the
crack just below a thin chimney, that started some
twenty feet above our heads. To get to this chimney
was the difficulty. Either the cleft or the corner
should be taken. Which was the easier?</p>

<p>I first tried the cleft, but it overhung so seriously
that I dared not venture further. Equally futile was
the attempt up the corner. Was it possible that we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
had mistaken the right take-off? To gain time and
recover our spirits we walked over to the other side
of Mickledore and prospected the climb. There
could be no doubt that I had actually started on
the correct way. Thirty feet up we could plainly
distinguish a grassy platform that promised us
temporary safety. If we could get as high
as that we had Dr. Collier’s authority that the
remainder of our chimney offered no such difficulties
as those we had overcome. Even if it
had, we could as a last resource fix an axe in the
chimney and descend on a doubled rope in the
usual Alpine fashion. In this manner, assuring ourselves
that we had the worst immediately before us,
we returned with some little courage to the attack.
This time we decided to take the corner. A. was to
stand on a small ledge about a foot above the Progress,
and brace himself firmly enough to hold my
weight. G. acted as a sort of flying buttress for his
brother, and paid out my rope with extreme care.
From A.’s shoulders I could just reach a high handhold
with the left. But one grip at that height was
useless, as the body had to be lifted up on to the rib
of rock separating the two clefts. A. then padded
his head with a handkerchief beneath his cap, and
begged me to stand on it. However steady a young
man may be, there are times when his friends think
him weak in the head. Such a time was this, and I
anxiously asked him if he could hold it perfectly still
while I used it. ‘You may do anything except
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
waltz on it,’ was the encouraging rejoinder, and I
promptly placed my left foot on his parietal. ‘That’s
all right,’ the tough young head called out, ‘you may
stay there all day if you like.’ This was reassuring,
but I had come out to climb and meant to move on.
Yet for the life of me I could not see what to do
next. The left foot required a lift before the high
handhold could be employed, and there was nothing
for it to rest against except the square corner of the
recess. Two or three times I tried hard to grip the
corner with the toe of my boot, but ineffectually.
Then A., seeing my trouble, reached up a hand and
held my boot on an infinitesimal ledge. It felt firm,
and I trusted to it. With the first movement
upwards my right hand felt a charmingly secure
depression in the rib above, and swinging clear from
A.’s head I dragged up on to the buttress and felt that
the game was half won already. The rib was easy
to ascend for a foot or two, till indeed it terminated
at the small chimney above. But caution was the
instinct uppermost in my mind, and the climb to the
grassy platform above might, in spite of appearances,
prove nasty. Casting around for some means of
anchoring on my own rope, I saw that in the crack
to my right a bunch of small stones were firmly
jammed, and that daylight could be seen behind them
down a hole that pointed through to the Progress,
fifteen feet below. Here was a chance that, if we had
known of it at first, might have been used to conserve
our strength and nerve from the start. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
others were as yet unroped. Calling to them to let
go the rope, I drew up the free end by my teeth and
my ‘unemployed’ hand, and let it fall straight down
the hole to them. If a fall occurred now in trying
the next few feet I could only tumble three or four
yards, and should not pass over my friends’ heads
and the Rake’s Progress. But the chimney into
which a few moves brought me was of no high order
of difficulty; the situation was certainly a trying
one, for a downward gaze could only take in the rib
of rock immediately below and the distant screes
200 feet beyond. I flung some loose stones far out
into space, and could only just hear a faint clatter as
they touched the scree. Now was the time to
appreciate the joy of climbing, in perfect health,
with perfect weather, and in a difficult place without
danger, and I secretly laughed as I called to the
others that the outlook was terribly bad and that
our enterprise must be given up. But they also
laughed, and told me to go higher and change my
mind, for they knew by the tone that my temper
was unruffled. A few feet more and I drew up to
the platform. It was about a yard wide and three
yards in length, reminding us strongly of the Tennis
Court ledge, a similar formation half way up Moss
Ghyll. Between the ledge and the wall rising above
it a fissure cut down into the mountain. It still
held some old winter snow, and its depths were cold
as a refrigerator. Shouting to the others to rope up
at a distance of thirty feet apart, I sat down on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
grass with my legs dangling in the frigid fissure,
bracing myself to stand any jerks that might be
given to the rope by a sudden slip of the second man
at the rounding of the rib. G. came up second, using
his brother’s shoulders and head much as I had used
them. When he reached the ledge he helped me to
haul his brother. A. was unable to stand on his
own head as we had done, though we reminded him
of Dent’s famous climber’s dream, and he hung on to
the rope with both hands while we pulled. It must
have been rather an unpleasant sensation that of
swinging away from the rocks, but he bore it like a
philosopher, and caught cleverly on to the rib and
so up to us. I am afraid our satisfaction was now
somewhat premature, but we were certain of a safe
descent whatever the remainder of our climb might
involve. But there was no sign of failure in store.
The chimneys above us looked steep, but they were
deeply carved and therefore safe. Also, they cut
obliquely up the vertical wall, and were not likely to
involve any inch-by-inch wrestling against gravity.
These surmises all proved correct, though we were
astonished at the ease with which the remaining
difficulties were overcome. It was now two o’clock
in the afternoon, and we had been half an hour
getting up the first thirty feet. The remainder only
took us an equal time, though five times the height,
and consisting of genuine rock-climbing all the way,
as the following notes testify.</p>

<p>After a short lunch and a few minutes spent in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
erecting a diminutive cairn, we moved on. Dr.
Collier had climbed into the upper part of the next
chimney by a traverse of some difficulty from the
right. I started the same course, but A. had
descended a little to look up the direct route, and
called out that it was safer, though perhaps awkward.
Therefore we all descended and entered the chimney,
which is practically a continuation of the crack up
which our climb had started. It sloped slightly to
the left, and offered just a sufficiency of holds,
without demoralizing us with a superfluity. In
fifteen feet its difficulties were over, and a few yards
higher we reached another grassy ledge, more
protected than the former but giving an equally
grand view of the neighbouring precipices. There
then followed a vertical pitch of twelve feet,
simple enough with the help of a shoulder&mdash;or
without it, for that matter&mdash;and an easy step
from the top towards the right led to the beginning
of the upward grassy traverse that so strikingly
marks the break in the continuity of direction of
Collier’s Climb. Many people have expressed doubts
as to the safety of this traverse; on the other hand,
these many have not all been there to see. The
route is perfectly safe; there are corners on the
Rake’s Progress that are intrinsically as hard,
though perhaps the sublime situation may have its
effect on some susceptible organisations. Possibly
in wintry weather the traverse may have its difficulties,
but if ever it were dangerous the first pitch
would be impossible.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>We found the first part of the final chimney
slightly moist. Probably it is very rarely dry. As
the diagram facing page 46 indicates, it slopes up
towards the left and is very deeply cut. The first
piece was practically a walk up a steep incline, using
tiny ledges that were disposed along the slope in the
most suitable places. It ended with a magnificent
pull up with the arms over a projecting edge on the
left.</p>

<p>Then came the pleasantest part of the whole, the
negotiation of twenty-five feet of smooth, slabby rock
by faith in friction and occasional reference to the
overhanging side of the gully. Collier had rightly
made special mention of this part, but to his account
I should like to add that with dry rock and rough
garments all will go well. Even a slip on the part
of the leader will not be serious if he is carefully
watched and fielded at the bottom of his slide.</p>

<p>At the finish of this exciting portion we saw the
sky-line a few feet in front of us, and with a spurt
we ran up and reached the summit breathless.</p>

<p>Since that time I have descended by the same
route with a different party. We had just come up
Moss Ghyll, and my two friends were well contented
with their day’s work; for Moss Ghyll had been the
limit of their ambition, and they were willing to rest
contentedly on their laurels. To tackle Collier’s
Climb had never entered their heads before&mdash;like
the death-dealing pebble for poor Goliath&mdash;and they
shyly suggested that we had climbed enough for one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
day. But with the sense of possession of a trump
card up my sleeve&mdash;that handy rope-hold at the
bottom pitch&mdash;I succeeded in rousing their enthusiasm
sufficiently, and we started downwards. They
were perfectly safe men to accompany; this had been
proved in Moss Ghyll, and it was perhaps not so
very wrong to indulge in a harmless exaggeration of
the excitement that the finish had in store for them.
But they climbed extremely well in spite of forebodings,
and gratified me immensely by agreeing that
for beauty of surroundings Collier’s Climb has no
equal in all the gullies of the Lake District. The
descent was rather easier than the ascent&mdash;a state of
things so often experienced in difficult climbing work&mdash;and
we reached the lowest grassy platform in half
an hour. There we found the little cairn I had erected
a few months before, and were cheered to see a couple
of friends approaching from Mickledore to give us
any aid necessary near the finish. I let down the
first man by the rope; he went well till within ten
feet of the Progress, and then, slipping away from the
hold, was left for an uncomfortable moment dangling
in mid-air. Lowered a yard or so his legs were seized
by the men below and he was pulled to their level in
safety. There he unroped, and thus also descended
the second man. But he came on the middle of the
rope, and before reaching the spot where he was
destined to quit the rocks he was instructed to slip
the lower end of the rope through the safety-hole.
On reaching the Progress he also unroped, and with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
the united strength of the party holding me through
the jammed stone I also was willing, when my turn
came to let myself hang and be lowered gently down
like a bale of goods into a ship’s hold.</p>

<p>To descend alone, without adventitious aid of this
kind, it would be better to take to the crack.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Keswick Brothers’ Climb.</span>&mdash;This occupies a
position between the two chief routes already described
in this chapter, but chronologically it comes
last, and on that account we find it best to treat of
it after the others. The brothers Abraham and I
had independently arrived at the conclusion that the
Scawfell face offered a feasible route between Collier’s
Climb and Moss Ghyll, of which only the lower half
required any elaborate planning. In the summer of
1897, before I had a suitable opportunity of trying
my fortune there, came the news that my two
friends had succeeded with their design, considerable
assistance having been given them by the preliminary
scrambling of Mr. J. W. Puttrell at the lower end of
the course.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day, 1897, I was one of a large
party exploring the new route and its environs. An
attempt to work directly up the long crack marked by
the top <i>e</i> in Plate II. was thwarted at a height of forty
feet or so above the Rake’s Progress by the smoothness
of the rocks, and by the presence of ice in the crack.
It will probably go some day when conditions are
more favourable. I managed to traverse to the edge
of the buttress on my left, but the prospect round
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
the corner was not a bit more attractive. A descent
was therefore effected and the ordinary route tackled
forthwith. It was interesting and remarkably safe.
We started close to the foot of Collier’s Climb, and,
working along a nearly horizontal cleft, arrived
without trouble at the corner of the rectangular
recess of which mention was made on page 30.</p>

<p class="small">(<i>Face page 66</i>)</p></div>

<p>Thence we had a steep bit of edgework for thirty
feet before the leader could ask his second to advance
from the Progress. This part admits of a little variation,
but the main fact to be grasped is that the long
chimney in which Collier’s Climb finishes is retained
close on our right for fully ten yards, until it
suddenly narrows, and a grass platform extends
away to the left with ample accommodation for a
score of people. This platform, in fact, is part of
the same grassy ledge that forms the first resting
place after the troublesome introduction to Collier’s
Climb; and since that date I have frequently taken
friends up and down the latter course by this variation.
The expedition is one that can be strongly
recommended for moderately good parties, both for
its beauty and its sustained interest throughout.
That day, however, our course was ordered differently.
We had first to follow the original line of ascent for
fifteen feet up an awkward chimney with its best
hold insecure. Then on reaching an upper grass
corner there came an open movement across the face
of rock to our right, working gradually upwards and
aiming for a narrow cleft that partially separated a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
small pinnacle from the face. The view of this
pinnacle from the middle of Collier’s Climb is simply
exquisite, well worth showing to an enterprising
camera.</p>

<p>From the pinnacle a slight descent gave an inspiring
view downwards of the long smooth corner
that I had unsuccessfully attacked a short time previously.
At our level the crack had expanded into
a respectable chimney, that could be easily entered
twenty feet higher after a brief clamber on the
buttress. It was disappointing to find then that
something very like a scree gully, with only moderately
interesting scrambling, was to finish our work
in the great cleft. Rather than close the operations
so quietly the majority voted for an attempt on the
slightly-indicated branch exit thirty feet to the right;
and their enterprise was rewarded by the conquest
of a particularly neat pitch at the top.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="large"><i>SCAWFELL PINNACLE</i></span></h2>

<p><span class="large2">Ordinary Route.</span>&mdash;This magnificent pinnacle
offers the finest bit of rock scenery in the Scawfell
<i>massif</i>. It rises up some 600 feet from the foot of
Lord’s Rake in steep and almost unclimbable slabs
of smooth rock, forming the left-hand boundary of
Deep Ghyll and the right of Steep Ghyll. The
latter, and the Professor’s Chimney springing up out
of Deep Ghyll, cut it away to some extent from the
main mountain mass, from which it is separated by
a narrow <i>col</i> or gap familiarly known as the ‘Jordan.’
Unfortunately this gap is too high, and the top of
the pinnacle is reached therefrom by a couple of
minutes’ scrambling. If only the gap were impossible
to reach from above, the climb of Scawfell Pinnacle
would necessarily involve some splendid work, and
it could almost claim the suggested name of the
Little Dru of the Lake District.</p>

<p>From a higher point of view Mr. Williamson’s
comparison is very apt. ‘The most conspicuous
object at the upper part of Deep Ghyll is a pinnacle
rock with some slight resemblance, from certain
points of view, to the celebrated Pieter Botte, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Mauritius, except that the stone on the top is much
smaller than the knob which forms the summit of
the Mauritius mountain. The Deep Ghyll Pinnacle
is perhaps best named the Scawfell Pillar, for on
examination it will be found to have several features
in common with the Ennerdale Pillar. Both have a
Pisgah rock and a Jordan gap, both have a High and
a Low Man, and both have a slanting slab in similar
positions. So inaccessible does the Scawfell Pillar
appear, that it is probable no one ever thought of
making an attempt upon it till Mr. W. P. Haskett
Smith, whose climbs on the Ennerdale Pillar were
referred to in a previous article, looking at the rock
with the eye of a genius for climbing, thought he
could see a way to the top. He made the attempt
alone in September of this year [1884] and successfully
reached the top, being the first man to set foot
on the summit of this ‘forbidden peak.’</p>

<p>But the gap can be reached easily from the
summit of Scawfell. If we walk over to the top of
Deep Ghyll we may look across to the pinnacle on
the right and notice the black out made by the
Professor’s Chimney that separates it from us. The
knob of rock to the right of the Jordan gap is
appropriately called ‘Pisgah’; it is almost exactly
of the same height as the cairn on the pinnacle, and
is barely thirty feet away from it. By rounding
Pisgah to the right, and carefully skirting the head
of Moss Ghyll, we reach the Jordan, and find ourselves
on a narrow ridge with extremely steep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
plunges on either side. The short climb that faces
us begins in an awkward way, for we have to get up
a few feet of overhanging rock before the slope
eases off, and a slip backwards of an unroped man
would inevitably result in a fall down the Professor’s
Chimney or down Steep Ghyll. The firmest rope
anchorage for the leader is at the top of Pisgah, but
with more to follow him the usual plan is to descend
to the gap and loop the rope over a large boulder
that lies on the crest of the <i>col</i>. He need not worry
about the danger of the pitch if the rocks are in
good condition. When Mr. Haskett Smith first
found this way up on September 3rd, 1884, a few
days before he reached the top by way of Steep
Ghyll, large quantities of moss had to be removed,
and the finger-holds cleared of earth before they
could be estimated and safely utilized. Not a
particle of moss remains here now; nay, more, a
decade of gymnasts have removed much rock by
dint of scraping with their nailed boots, and have
made obvious the safest route to the summit.</p>

<p>It starts a yard or two to the right of the gap,
where a sloping foothold in the overhanging wall
shows traces of considerable wear and tear. The
hands can find a sufficient bearing pressure near
the edge of rock above, but it is unwise to place
them too high up on the sloping slab. Then,
straightening out on the foothold for a moment, the
left hand can find a thin crack good enough for a
hold while the body is being levered up over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
awkward edge. Then the crack can be followed up
the slab to the left till it ends near a little chimney,
up which a scramble of six feet brings the climber
within touch of the cairn. Formerly a small tin box
held many visiting cards, and an ancient pocketbook
with the names of the early climbers of the
pinnacle. It was almost a breach of etiquette to pay
a call here without leaving a card, but the polite
old days are past, and men come and go now without
this ceremony. A year ago I hunted in vain for the
box and fancied that some curiosity-monger had
feloniously appropriated it, but since then I believe
it has again been seen there. It may easily slip
down between the loose stones.</p>

<p>This little climb is dangerous in icy weather, and
should not then be undertaken. For there is no
particular fun in it when the rocks are glazed, when
bare fingers are necessary for the diminished holds,
and the slow going inevitably involving benumbed
hands.</p>

<p>The long routes up are impossible except when
conditions are favourable.</p>

<p class="small">(<i>Face page 73</i>)</p></div>

<p>The first long way up the pinnacle was climbed
on September 20th, 1884, by Messrs. Haskett Smith
and John Robinson. They made the ascent of Steep
Ghyll, and then, emerging on the right, climbed up
a steep <i>arête</i> to the pinnacle, where they left their
names in a glass bottle. Descending again to the
upper portion of Steep Ghyll, they passed over to
the Jordan and so on to the mountain. With but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
slight variations, these were the only ways known
until 1888. In July of that year a party led by Mr.
W. Cecil Slingsby succeeded in climbing out from
the lower part of Steep Ghyll on to the north-east
face of the pinnacle. By a long and difficult chimney
in this wall they reached the Low Man, as the nearly
horizontal crest of the first huge buttress is called.
Thence a sharp ridge took them direct to the final
rocks, which were sufficiently broken to make the
finish easy. This route at once commended itself to
the better climbers at Wastdale as being safe and
sound. The rocks throughout are excellent, and
indeed enthusiasts like to compare the finish with
the famous ridge of the Rothhorn from Zinal. The
chief objection to be urged against the climb is the
exposure to wind and cold. I remember once
starting up with Mr. Robinson one wet day in
August. He led as far as the foot of the difficult
Slingsby Chimney, and then resolutely refused to
budge an inch further because of the wind, which he
asseverated would blow us away to Hollow Stones.
I am inclined to believe him now, but at the time
we wrangled all the way down to the Lord’s Rake,
where some damp but enterprising tourist, pointing
up to the vertical crags down which we had been
dodging our way, inquired in a feeble tenor voice:
‘Is there a road up there?’</p>

<p>It was not until December 31, 1893, that I made
my first complete ascent by this route, accompanied
by M. and C., the latter leading all the way up. We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
crossed the foot of Lord’s Rake, and made for the
slight suggestion of a gully that serves to mark the
beginning of the ordinary Steep Ghyll Climb. It
was quite easy to follow, and rapidly deepened as we
rose. In a hundred feet we were in view of the
enormous cleft of the ghyll, with its black and
glistening walls apparently almost meeting each
other a hundred feet over our heads. None of us
were attracted by that climb, which is never quite
free from hazard, and we looked about for the spot
where our route diverged to the right. Here the
side of the ghyll was very steep for thirty or forty
feet up, but was cut about by ledges and clefts quite
good enough for us to mount the wall safely. Then
we bore up a little towards the left, so as to approach
the smooth outer face of the Low Man. Advance
was only possible in one direction, our course taking
us out on a nose or pinnacle of rock separated from
the main mass by a deep fissure.</p>

<p>The position was very exposed. It could only
be approached from one direction, that of Steep
Ghyll. A glance down the fissure beneath us
revealed the lower half of the tremendous wall to
which we were clinging, and though we had plenty
of room to sit down and rest ourselves, there was a
sense of coming peril in the next move. The illustration
facing page 73, taken off the wall from the Lord’s
Rake ridge, shows the pinnacle and the fissure that
partially separates it from the face. Standing on the
highest available point, C. had next to draw himself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
up on to the little shelf by means of the smallest of
holds and the use of his knees. We were able to
guard against his slipping back, and were glad to see
him clamber up easily to the beginning of the Slingsby
Chimney. This begins very awkwardly; it would be
proof of unusual agility and nerve for the leader here
to manage the first six feet without assistance from
below. But an unaided ascent is not impossible, and
careful examination will generally cause the climber
to discount much of the terror that he is pretty sure
to have invested in the spot after reading the early
literature of the subject. We hoisted C. up on our
shoulders; without hesitation he crept well into the
crack vertically above our heads, and wriggled his
way out of sight. When we had paid out forty feet
of rope, he shouted out to M. to advance, and I was
left to speculate on a possible variation of the ascent
by the left of the chimney. In due course M. was
firmly fixed, and my turn came. The steepness of
the first fifteen feet was rather appalling, but it was
so simple a matter to wedge firmly into the chimney
that there was no sense of insecurity. After the
vertical bit, the chimney sloped back at an easier
angle, and though some distance had to be climbed
before a man might be of much help to those behind
he would be perfectly capable of looking after himself.
When we reached this level the aspect of
the remaining rocks was very much less threatening.
It was still a matter of hand-and-foot work, but we
could all forge ahead together instead of moving one at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
a time. The slope eased off again when we reached
the Low Man, and by preference we kept to the
ridge on the right as much as we could. This was
for the sensational view down into Deep Ghyll,
though that day we saw little but the rolling mist
above and below us. The rock was firm and rough
to the touch, and we could well appreciate the comparison
with the best parts of the Zinal Rothhorn.
Leslie Stephen’s frontispiece in the ‘Playground of
Europe’ might have been drawn on our ridge. There
was a sense of perfect security out there as we sat
astride the sharp ridge or clasped the huge blocks
with a fraternal embrace. My only regret was that
the <i>arête</i> was all too short&mdash;we arrived at the
pinnacle much too soon. I proposed to descend to
the Jordan and down by the Professor’s Chimney,
but my companions pointed out that the latter
would be damp and rickety, and such a change from
our recent sport that we could get little fun out
of it. I reluctantly yielded to the vote of the
majority and went off to a halting-place in the
hollow at the head of the Moss Ghyll variation
exit.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Scawfell Pinnacle, Deep Ghyll route.</span>&mdash;In
October, 1887, a strong party led by the brothers
Hopkinson found a way down the outside face of the
Scawfell Pinnacle, to a point on the ridge within a
hundred feet of the first pitch in Deep Ghyll. There
they built what is now known as the Hopkinsons’
cairn. In April, 1893, Messrs. C. Hopkinson and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
Tribe worked up the left wall of the ghyll from the
second pitch, and reached the main north <i>arête</i>
about sixty feet above the cairn. They were
apparently unable to force a way directly up the
ridge, and managed instead to descend it for a few
yards and then to climb up the face of the Low Man
by the 1887 route on the east side of the <i>arête</i>.</p>

<p class="small">(<i>Face page 76</i>)</p></div>

<p>They thus succeeded in reaching the summit of
the pinnacle from Deep Ghyll, and an examination of
the illustration facing page 83 of the great wall that
they climbed will prove that the performance was an
unusually brilliant one. (The photograph shows the
north ridge twenty feet to the left of the leader, who
is about forty feet above the second man.)</p>

<p>Very little was generally known of that day’s
work, the note in the Wastdale climbing book being
of the briefest description; and it cannot be counted
unto me for originality that in a climb made in 1896
that was intended as a repetition of the above our
party left the older route at a point eighty feet up
the Deep Ghyll wall, and reached the Low Man by a
new line of advance.</p>

<p>We were a party of three. Messrs. George and
Ashley Abraham were very keen on trying the new
route, and equally anxious to get some good photographs
of the great wall. We climbed up the first
pitch in Deep Ghyll by the crack on the left, and
took the second in the ordinary way. Just where
the traverse commences fifteen feet above the top of
the central obstacle, a crack starts up the left wall,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
with a prominent jammed block guarding its entrance.
Traversing over a leaf of rock on to the jammed
stone, I was steadied for the first twenty feet of
ascent by the rope, and could not have come to much
harm in the event of a slip. But there was scanty
room for a second, and I was compelled to rise with
an ever lengthening rope below me. The crack was
followed closely, though it soon became so thin and
so erect that there was nothing to do but keep on
the face of the mountain just to its left, every now
and then gripping its sharp edge for handhold. It
seemed to be a virgin climb, though this part had
really been visited two or three times before. Stones
had to be flung down, and grit scraped from the
tiny ledges. But on the whole that first sixty feet
was not very difficult, though markedly sensational,
and I went on slowly to a little niche in the wall.</p>

<p>The eighty-feet length of rope just reached to the
crack from which the start was made, and getting
George to tie himself on at the lower extremity, I
mounted to a higher and larger niche while he
cautiously climbed up the crack. The situation was
very novel. Some may remember the <i>firma loca</i> in
Mr. Sanger Davies’ account of the Croda da Lago.
This grass-floored hermitage of mine was truly a
<i>firma loca</i>, and sitting down comfortably in it I took
out a biscuit from my pocket and tried to realize
all the view.</p>

<p>It was every bit as appalling as a Dolomite climb.
Direct progress upwards seemed quite impossible; a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
feasible traverse over some badly-sloping moss-covered
ledges to the right led to the sky-line at a
spot where the <i>arête</i> made a vertical spring upwards
for forty feet. A descent would have been seriously
difficult, but it was the one thing we did not want.
I could hear another climbing party finishing an
ascent of the pinnacle by the ordinary route, their
voices echoing down the ghyll and cheering me with
a sense of neighbourliness. My companions were
holding an animated discussion below on the subject
of photography. The light was excellent, and our
positions most artistic. The cameras were left in the
cave at the foot of the ghyll. Ashley was afraid I
meant to go up without him; but his professional
instinct got the better of his desire to climb, and,
shouting out to us to stay where we were for five
minutes, he ran round to the high-level traverse on
the other side of the ghyll, and down the Lord’s
Rake to the cavern.</p>

<p>George had the tripod screw and could not hand
it to his brother; so, asking me to hold him firmly
with the rope, he practised throwing stones across
the gully to the traverse. Then, tying the screw to
a stone, he managed to project this over successfully.
We composed our limbs to a photographic quiescence.
Ashley had a splendid wide-angle lens, which, from
his elevated position on the traverse opposite, could
take in 400 feet of the cliff, showing the entire route
to the summit. It was his turn to take the lead.
‘Mr. Jones! I can’t see you, your clothes are so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
dark.’ I apologized. ‘Will you step out a foot or
two from that hole?’ I was in a cheerful mood and
ready to oblige a friend, but the platform was
scarcely two feet square, and to acquiesce was to step
out a few hundred feet into Deep Ghyll. For this I
had not made adequate preparation and told him so.
‘Well, will you take off your coat?’ That I could
do with pleasure, and for a while his instructions
were levelled at George.</p>

<p>He was in an awkward place and was much
cramped in ensuring safety, but Ashley was dissatisfied
and insisted on his lifting the left leg. This
gave him no foothold to speak of, but in the cause
of photography he had been trained to manage
without such ordinary aids. He grumbled a little at
the inconvenience but obeyed, resolving that if he
were living when the next slide was to be exposed he
himself would be the manipulator and his brother the
centre of the picture. The ghyll had become rather
gloomy and we had a lengthy exposure. I was glad
to slip on my jacket again and draw in the rope for
George’s ascent. When he reached the smaller
platform just below me, we tried the traverse over
the slabs to the north ridge, and found that it went
well enough. We were delighted to find traces of the
previous party on the rocks at the corner. They
were made by the Hopkinsons three years before
(April 2, 1893) in their attempt to mount by the
ridge. Their cairn was fifty feet further down, and
we now had the satisfaction of seeing for ourselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
how to connect the Hopkinson cairn directly with
Deep Ghyll.</p>

<p>Then came the question of getting our third man
up. We tried to throw the rope-end to him, but it
persisted in clinging to the face vertically below us
and would not be caught. I had to return to the
<i>firma loca</i> and throw the rope from there. Ashley
now reached it safely, tied himself on, and hastened
up to our level, having left his camera on the traverse
below. In this way we found ourselves together
again, on the corner of the <i>arête</i>. The others fixed
themselves to a little belaying-pin while I attempted
to swarm up the vertical corner. A couple of feet
above their heads I found that the only available
holds were sloping the wrong way. They could be
easily reached, but were unsafe for hauling, and after
clinging for some minutes without advancing an inch
I was compelled to descend and reconsider the
problem. I thought of Andrea del Sarto:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah! but a man’s reach should exceed his grasp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or what’s a Heaven for?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and wondered whether Browning meant this to
apply to the crests of climbing-pitches as well as to
other objects in life.</p>

<p>At the time we did not know the exact history of
the early attempts on the <i>arête</i>. As far as we could
judge our corner might be inaccessible except with
the help of a rope fixed above us. Certainly the
scoring of bootnails on the face was scanty. The
earlier party three years before might have planned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
to avoid the bad bit. With doubts like these, I
craved permission to look up a chimney on the Deep
Ghyll side of the ridge. The other party of climbers
had now reached the top of the ghyll, and were
watching our manœuvres with interest. Seeing my
hesitation they called out to inquire whether we
should like a rope from the Low Man. We were
grateful for the suggestion, but there was no peril
our position, and we asked them to wait for awhile
at the top of the gully, and see the issue of our next
attempt upwards. Then, traversing over a buttress,
I looked up and down the chimney.</p>

<p>It was what is generally called hopeless. To speak
definitely, it was much worse than the <i>arête</i>, and
seeing no alternative I returned to the corner and
prepared for another attempt. This time Ashley
gave me a shoulder at a slightly lower level on the
ghyll side of the ridge. A trying drag upwards with
very scanty fingerholds brought my knees on to a
satisfying hollow in a little ledge, and steadied by
the two side faces of the sloping slab I stepped up
and on to it. The cheers of the observing party told
us that our <i>mauvais pas</i> was practically overcome.
The other two men came up with a little assistance
from the rope, and we cleared away the loose stones
from our platform. It shelved badly downwards and
offered no guarantee of safety in case I fell from the
next vertical bit. But George sturdily rammed his
brother close against the wall and intimated that the
two would accept the responsibility of fielding me if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
necessary. I mounted their shoulders, and reached
up at arm’s length to a sharp and firm edge of rock.
A preliminary grind of my boot into a shoulder-blade
and then a clear swing out on the arms, a desperate
pull-up with knees and toes vainly seeking support,
and at last the upper shelf was mounted. But we
were all breathless.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Ascent of Scawfell Pinnacle from Deep Ghyll</span></p>

<p class="small">(<i>Face page 83</i>)</p></div>

<p>The lower edge of the broken crest of rock that
marks the Low Man was now close at hand. Close
by was the fine cairn built when the pinnacle was
first climbed from Lord’s Rake. A few yards off to
the east the edge of the cliff was cut by the top of
Slingsby’s Chimney, and before us remained the
magnificent ridge up to the summit.</p>

<p>Boot scratches were now numerous, both along
the ridge and by the left. We took the finish hand
over hand, and reached the pinnacle cairn in five
minutes. Our time up from Lord’s Rake had been
slow&mdash;something like four hours&mdash;but much had
been spent with photography and in reconnoitring.
Another day, two years later, I managed it in less
than half the time.</p>

<p>A party of three should have 150 feet of rope, or
else our awkward tactics in letting the rope down to
the ghyll would have to be repeated. Perhaps the
long run out for the leader will prevent this route
ever becoming popular. It is a great pity that there
is no resting-place half way up the wall. With icy
conditions it would be criminal to attempt the open
face. Yet the climb is one of the very best in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
district, and I shall always look back with pleasure
to my first introduction to this side of Scawfell
Pinnacle.</p>

<p>We hurried down Deep Ghyll by the traverse
above both pitches. One of us rushed down too
jubilantly, and ill repaid the kindly attention of the
other party, now below us, by a profuse shower of
stones. With thoughts of all the possible consequences
of this indiscretion, we picked up our
cameras and strode more sedately down to the others
and to Wastdale.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Scawfell Pinnacle from Lord’s Rake.</span>&mdash;A
very fine expedition was undertaken in December,
1887, by Messrs. C. Hopkinson, Holder, H. Woolley,
and Bury. Their note on the day’s sport is quoted
almost in full: ‘Three of the party, led by Hopkinson,
made an attempt on the Deep Ghyll Pinnacle from
the entrance to Lord’s Rake. They succeeded in
climbing 150 to 200 feet, but were stopped by a
steep slab of rock coated with ice. From this point,
however, a good traverse was made to the first gully,
or chimney, on the left. They forced their way up
this gully to the top of the chimney. At the top
there was a trough of ice about 30 feet long, surmounted
by steep rocks glazed with ice, which
brought the party to a stop. They descended the
chimney again and returned to Wastdale, unanimously
of opinion that the day’s excursion had
afforded one of the finest climbs the party had ever
accomplished.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>So we may well think, and it is a great pity that
the icy conditions of the rock prevented their direct
ascent into Slingsby’s chimney. The gully they
entered and almost completely ascended, is marked
plainly in the general view of the Scawfell Crags
from the Pulpit, and at first sight appears to run
up continuously to Slingsby’s chimney. Actually,
however, it finishes on the side of the nose or
pinnacle of rock a few feet lower down, and I believe
this pinnacle could be ascended from it by either
side. What this earlier party found impossible in
the Winter of 1887, Mr. G. T. Walker and I in
April, 1898, favoured by the best of conditions,
were just able to overcome. We had spent a long
and exciting day in the neighbourhood, and were
descending Slingsby’s chimney late in the afternoon,
when we were suddenly struck with the idea of
descending the fissure behind the nose and prospecting
the face of rock between it and Deep Ghyll.
A rough inspection of the first fifty feet below us
proving satisfactory, we hastened down Steep Ghyll
and traversed across to the top of the first pitch in
Deep Ghyll. In spite of the late hour I could not
refrain from a trial trip on the edge of the great Low
Man buttress. At the point where the earlier party
found the direct ascent barred by smooth ice on the
wall, and decided to traverse off to the gully on the
left, we had a council of war. It resulted in my
throwing down my boots to Walker, and then
crawling up fifty feet of, perhaps, the steepest and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
smoothest slabs to which I have ever trusted myself.
This brought me to a tiny corner where I essayed to
haul in the rope attached to my companion. But he
also had to remove his boots and traverse to a point
vertically below me before he could follow up in safety.
We were now some distance to the left of the edge of
Deep Ghyll, and straight up above us we could
distinguish the crack where our new route was to
terminate. Getting Walker to lodge firmly in a
notch somewhat larger than mine, six feet away on
the Steep Ghyll side, I went off again up another
forty feet of smooth rock, aided by a zig-zagging
crack an inch or so in width, that supplied sufficient
lodgment for the toes, and a moderate grip for the
finger-tips. After both had arrived thus far, we
were able, with extreme care, to reach the side wall
of the nose itself, and at a point, perhaps, fifty feet
from its crest we turned round its main outside
buttress and found ourselves in a spacious chamber
with a flat floor and a considerable roof, the first and
only genuine resting-place worthy the name that we
found along our route. We could look straight
down Hopkinson’s gully, and would gladly have
descended into it and ‘passed the time of day’ with
a little speculative scrambling thereabouts. But
darkness was coming on apace, and we had yet a
most awkward corner to negotiate before finishing
our appointed business. Standing on Walker’s
shoulders I screwed myself out at the right-hand
top corner of our waiting-room, and started along a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
traverse across the right face of the nose. The toes
of the feet were in a horizontal crack, the heels had
no support, and the hands no grip. It was only by
pressing the body close to the wall, which was
fortunately a few degrees away from the perpendicular,
and by sliding the feet along almost inch by inch,
that the operation could be effected. It was with
no small sense of relief that the end was reached in
a few yards, and a narrow vertical fissure entered
that gave easy access to the top of the nose. Then
we put on our boots again and hurried.</p>

<p>It is thus possible to reach the summit of the
Scawfell Pinnacle by a route up the buttress quite
independent of either of the great ghylls that flank it.
A good variation that has yet to be performed in its
entirety, though I believe that every section has been
independently climbed, is that of the Hopkinson’s
chimney, the nose, and Slingsby’s chimney. Further,
that evening’s climb has convinced me that we could
have safely reached Hopkinson’s cairn on the edge of
Deep Ghyll, and that there is in consequence a most
thrilling piece of work possible in the direct ascent
of the buttress, the whole way up to the High Man
from its base. Slight divergences are, probably,
unavoidable in the lower half of the climb, but
permitting these there now remain only about forty
feet of rock hitherto unascended. It is worth while
inspecting the view on page 73. The top of the
nose is there plainly seen in profile 4⅜ inches from
the bottom; our climb was roughly speaking up to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
the nose, by a vertical line drawn an inch from
the left edge of the picture&mdash;somewhat less as it
approached completion.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Upper Deep Ghyll Route.</span>&mdash;Three days after
the ascent recorded in the last section, I found that
the sharp ridge between the Low Man and the
summit of the pinnacle could be reached from the
foot of the lowest pitch of the Professor’s Chimney.
The suggestion is due to Dr. Collier, who told me
some years ago that the only real difficulties are
concentrated in the first thirty feet of the ascent.
The climb is almost in a straight line, running
obliquely up the Deep Ghyll face of the Pinnacle,
and is best inspected from the west wall traverse.
The first part overhangs considerably, and the holds
are of the same character as those on the long slabs
of the Low Man buttress, with a sort of absent
look about them. But the rocks were dry and
warm, in the best possible condition, and two minutes
of deliberate movement led me out of danger. There
is great variety just here, but the simplest course
was to make for a slight chimney in the sharp ridge
above my head. In twenty minutes the High Man
had been crossed, and the starting-point reached by
way of the Professor’s Chimney, but if a companion
and a long rope had been vouchsafed on that occasion
it would have been a pleasing undertaking to have
tried the traverse along the wall to the <i>firma loca</i> of
the second section in this chapter.

<span class="large"><i>GREAT END AND ITS GULLIES</i></span></h2>

<p>As we walk up towards the Styhead Pass from
Wastdale we may see well in front of us the long ridge
of the Pikes monopolizing a goodly portion of the
sky-line. The high dependence at the head of the
valley we are skirting is Great End, a reasonable
enough name for the north-east head of the range.
It sends down a buttress towards the Styhead Pass
that, at a closer view, is shown to be well separated
from the main mass by a deep gully of some
architectural merit. This is Skew Ghyll. It twists its
way up to the ridge, and offers a pleasant variation
route over to Sprinkling Tarn, whence a steep rise
brings the tourist to the Esk Hause, the lowest point
between Great End and Bowfell. The climber’s
interest will be concentrated in the view of the
long northern face of Great End, well seen from
Sprinkling Tarn, and his experienced eye will notice
at once that the face is marked by various gullies
that invite approach. The whole ground has been
thoroughly well examined from time to time, with
the result that several gullies which from below or
above appear to promise continuous climbing have
proved to be deceptive in this respect. Yet there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
remain two that are always interesting, and a third
that is at any rate popular as a winter course.</p>

<p>Seen from the tarn there are two gullies that cut
the full height of the precipice from top to bottom.
The lines of fresh scree that trail down from their
lower ends show up plainly on the older <i>débris</i>
that marks the decay of this mountain wall. They
both slope downwards towards the left when seen
from this point, and are both obviously provided
with variation exits at their upper extremities. That
to the left was formerly called Robinson’s Gully, but
is now generally known as the South-east Gully.
There has always been a lack of originality in the
nomenclature of such places, and with several routes
on the same mountain the christener’s wits seem
driven to all points of the compass. The second
gully is a hundred yards to the right of the first,
and has long been known as the Great End Central
Gully. It divides half way up into two well-marked
portions, the right-hand route constituting
the main bed of the gully, and terminating at a
huge notch in the sky-line. The left-hand branch
as seen from below appears to terminate blindly in
the face, but actually it leads to a deep and narrow
chimney cutting into the top wall within a hundred
feet of the main gully.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Great End Gullies seen from Sprinkling Tarn</span></p>

<p class="small">(<i>Face page 90</i>)</p></div>

<p>Far away to the right, where the cliff has shrunk
to but one-third of its full height at the Central
Gully, a black cleft may be descried that leads from
scree to sky-line. This is Cust’s Gully, indifferent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
as a summer climb, but always beautiful in the richness
of its rock scenery, and especially interesting in
winter, when drift snow offers a royal road to the
top. Every one has a kind word for Cust’s Gully.
It is only called the Cussed gully by ignorant
novices who inquire whether Skew of Skew Ghyll
fame was a member of the Alpine Club. When it
is marked out by snow we can from the path just
distinguish the great rock bridge or natural arch
across the upper part of the cleft.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Great End Central Gully.</span>&mdash;This wonderful
ravine offers some special feature every winter. Its
individuality changes so completely under the mask
of snow, or ice, or rain, that an attempt to describe
the gully by an account of any one expedition must
of necessity be only partially successful.</p>

<p>One fine winter morning a year or so ago we had
a large party at Wastdale, and for once in a way
were all of the same mind as to our day’s plans.
The walk up towards the Styhead Pass&mdash;the Schweinhauskopfjoch
of the Swiss travellers among us&mdash;would
just suit our conversationally-minded fraternity,
to whom Brown Tongue or the Pillar Fell
or the Gable-end offered gradients too steep for
words. We sallied forth from the inn with many
axes and great lengths of rope, and lazily worked
our way along the valley. The lower path, entirely
obliterated by the snow, took us across the stream
to the right on to the low slopes of Lingmell.
Piers Ghyll stream was crossed without notice, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
here the gorge is not at all in evidence and requires
closer examination to reveal its magnificence. Then,
rising a few feet, we crossed the hollow of Grainy
Ghyll and made towards Spout Head and Skew Ghyll.
The snow gave us some glorious effects on the hills
around. The Mosedale amphitheatre of noble mountains
towered above Wastdale, and mutely questioned
us as to the accuracy of the surveyors who could
give them not even three thousand feet of elevation
above us. Nowadays theodolites are taken to the
mountains and misused with great effect; why should
not the Pillar and Red Pike benefit similarly to the
extent of a thousand feet or so? There above us on
our left was Great Gable, a White pyramid cutting
into a dark sky, at least ten thousand feet of mountain
beauty between us and its snowy crest. Who could
believe that the summit was only 2,900 feet above
sea level? But the engineer among us calmly
reminded me of an interesting aneroid observation I
had once taken of the top of Moss Ghyll on Scawfell,
making it a hundred feet higher than Scawfell itself.
Was I to rank myself as a truthful scientist and be
contented with the ordnance survey records, or as
an artist who should represent heights, shapes, and
colours as his imperfect senses make them? We
closed the discussion in favour of the artist and then
sloped (without slang) up to Skew Ghyll.</p>

<p>This was in splendid condition; the snow was
deep and hard, and out of sheer pleasure in step-cutting,
three or four enthusiasts carved their own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
staircases up through the ‘narrows’ and away
towards the little pass above us. It was to be noticed
that the steps gradually converged to one line as
the leaders felt their muscles wearying, and they were
willing to fall in with the caravan now trailing up
in single file like the elements of a kite’s tail. At the
top of our little pass we could see straight down
Borrowdale. Skiddaw and Blencathara formed the
distant background. Derwent-water reflected a dark
sky, and by contrast with its snowy shores looked of
an inky blackness. Styhead Tarn was not very beautiful;
ice had formed on it a week before, but had
since been broken up by the wind, and the great
flakes of crystal unevenly crusted with drift snow
gave a sense of roughness and of incompleteness out
of keeping with the finished beauty of the surroundings.</p>

<p>We stayed up here for a few minutes, and then
contoured along the side of Great End in the direction
of Esk Hause. The ground was rough; here and
there the snow required cutting. But no difficulties
were met with until the narrow entrance to the Central
Gully suddenly disclosed itself in the precipitous
wall on our right. The gully points down towards
the eastern corner of Sprinkling Tarn. It begins
where the cliff stands nearest to the Esk Hause path,
and is not to be mistaken for the South-east Gully
that points directly towards the sharp bend in the
little stream rattling down to Borrowdale.</p>

<p>At the entrance to our climb we stopped to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
consider the question of roping up. ‘Union is
strength’ only within certain narrow limits, when
the bond of union is an Alpine rope. It often
involves loss of time.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Down to Gehenna or up to the Throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He travels the fastest who travels alone,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and his speed is inversely proportional to the number
of his followers. We decided to split up into three
equal parties of four, my men to lead up the main
gully, the engineer to convey the second set up the
middle course, and the more substantial residue to
bear to the left, up a slighter branch that contains
a very creditable cave pitch half-way towards the
summit ridge.</p>

<p>Our work was easy at the outset. The gully
was narrow and steep, but the snow was good, and
small ledges on either side were utilized whenever
the little icicle-clad pitches were too slippery for
direct attack. Where the gully widened a little we
could see the first serious obstacle in front of us&mdash;a
vertical wall with a ragged ice-curtain flung over it
in a most artistic way. It would perhaps have been
possible to cut directly upwards, but the crowd of
eager climbers behind could not be expected to fight
against frostbite for an hour or so while the leader
amused himself, and the obvious method of circumventing
the difficulty had its own merits. The right
wall slightly overhung; close below was a glazed
rib of rock leading up at an easy angle to the top of
the pitch.

<p>Steadying myself against the wall, I started cutting
slight steps up the thin ice on the rock, keeping
as near to the corner as possible. Now and again
the foothold felt insecure, but for the most part the
ascent was safe, with slight probability of a slip
into the snow below. The second man followed
close up, and steadied my feet occasionally with an
ice-axe. Then came a more gentle snow-slope, up
which we could kick steps without effort; and while
the second party were busy with the difficulties that
we had just overcome, we reached the second pitch
and hastened to leave it behind us. This was rather
a harder task than we had yet undertaken. The
gully was more open and its ice covering less extensive,
but the pitch was higher and involved our
climbing up to the centre from the right-hand wall,
so as to reach the base of the big boulder that crowns
the pitch. All this would have been easy with the
rocks clear and dry, but we had to make our footholds
on the flimsiest rags of ice, and the traverse to the
middle demanded some long stepping with scarcely
a hand to steady. On reaching the boulder I was
compelled to crawl on all-fours round its front to the
slope on the left-hand side of the gully, and then by
cutting a dozen steps or so in the hard snow found
myself in the wide part of the gully at the foot of the
great divide. The others of my party followed on
rapidly, and we shouted adieu to our companions
beneath.</p>

<p>Here we had the finest view of the climb.
Below, the beauties of the two pitches were greatly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
increased by our own elevation. They looked very
difficult, and the picture offered its living element in
the cautiously advancing parties now just in the
interesting part of the climb. Above us rose the
huge buttress that divides the gully, and on either
side the most fantastic drapery of ice well-nigh
frightened us with its appearance of impregnability.
We advanced carefully up to the right, congratulating
ourselves on having taken the lead, for our
friends were not pleased with the battery of hard
chips of snow that our step-cutting gave them. The
buttress was rounded, and we gained a full view of
the troubles in store for us. Immediately on our left
a smooth rock-shoot led straight up to the top of the
buttress. Between the vertical pillar on the right of
this shoot and the opposite side of the gully rose a
sheer wall of ice, like a frozen waterfall twenty-five
feet in height. So far as we could see at first, there
was no chance of forcing a quick way up this
obstacle, and it was obvious that slowness would
introduce the risk of frostbite. During the previous
summer my fingers had been rather badly frostbitten
in the Alps, and there was some chance of their
still manifesting a susceptibility to cold. We almost
turned back to follow our friends up another way;
we could trust each other to exaggerate the terrors
of this bit, which honestly enough was a trifle too
stiff for a cold winter day. But while mentally
framing an excuse for the return, I had advanced up
to the left-hand edge of the ‘ice fall,’ and started the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
ascent of its spiky edging of rock. From below the
spikes had appeared fragile and untrustworthy.
Actually they were too well frozen into place to
become detached with one’s cautious drag. This
discovery altered the prospect for us all, and the
chilly watchers below warmed up with the returning
enthusiasm. In fact they needed reminding that I
might yet come down suddenly to their level and
sweep them off their feet unless they were prepared
to receive me. When ten feet up, the axe was called
into requisition to cut a few steps in the fall itself.
These were useful just so long as the left hand could
utilise the rocks, but they tended to carry me away
from my comparatively safe corner, and I soon
decided to keep away from the fall as far as possible.
The corner where the gully sloped back was very
exciting, for implicit trust was reposed in the
benumbed left hand that had been thrust, well gloved,
into a thin and icy crack in the wall, and held there
by frost and friction. It offered no sensation either
of security or of danger, but it could not very well
slip out, and we hoped for the best. A few moments’
struggling landed me safely on the steep slope above
the pitch, and a vigorous handling of the ice-axe on
the bed of the gully fully restored circulation to my
hands. Then followed my cold companions, who had
been shivering spectators for a long twenty minutes.
They were thus handicapped from the outset, and
found the pitch very severe, notwithstanding the
gentle suggestion of safety that the rope offered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>We had some careful work still before us. The
bed of the gully led steeply up to another large
and slightly overhanging boulder that blocked the
direct route, and our only possible method of getting
above it was to cut steps away on the right, trusting
to sundry very insecure grass holds. But these were
much better than usual by reason of the frost. In
fact the whole climb is perfectly sound in winter,
though rendered very difficult. In summer it is
often easy but dangerous.</p>

<p class="caption">TOP OF THE CENTRAL GULLY, IN WINTER.
GREAT END</p></div>

<p>From the steep right-hand side of the gully we
could traverse with care to the main bed again, just
above the boulder; whence to the top of the gully,
looking from here like an Alpine pass, was a broad
stretch of unspotted snow. There we joined the
second party, who had come by the steep grass
ledges of the central route. Their labours had
been great&mdash;or else, indeed, they would easily have
managed to get ahead of us&mdash;but not so much
from the intrinsic difficulty of their route as from
the need of continual caution in the more open
portions of the climb. They had reached a ledge
that overlooked the right branch, and were proposing
to descend to our snow slope and cut steps up
with us. We were nothing loth to give them a
chance of showing their skill with the axe, and
for a while halted to enjoy the grand prospect
behind us, looking straight away towards Sprinkling
Tarn and Borrowdale. But we found ourselves frequently
buffeted by strong gusts of wind that swept
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
furiously down the gully. The whirling snow at the
little <i>col</i>, now so near, warned us of an approaching
<i>tourmente</i> on the ridge. Our section soon decided
to start again, and just below a small cornice that
crowned the gully we forged ahead, and plunged
through the powdery fringe of overhanging snow.
We sank in up to our waists, and had to wrestle
mightily against the hurricane to find a firm footing
on the wind-swept rocks beyond. It was no joke
standing about there with the sharp, cold, drift
snow from the Pikes blowing into our smarting faces.
We could not hear ourselves speak, it was almost
impossible to see the correct course; but there were
two or three among us well acquainted with this
ridge in its bitterest moods, and to these the others
trusted. We floundered down to the right towards
Esk Hause across the wilderness of blocks strewn
over the great plateau, and in a hundred yards
came to a boulder large enough to possess a lee
side of its own. Here we halted for a chilly half-hour,
waiting for the third section to arrive. I
possessed their luncheon in my knapsack, a most
regrettable circumstance from our point of view, inasmuch
as it tied us to Great End so long as it pleased
them to amuse themselves down there on the leeside
of the mountain. We quickly demolished our own
share of the provisions, and with an unselfishness
rarely present in the great latterday mountaineering
expeditions, decided to leave them a few sandwiches
and to cloy the hungry edge of our remaining appetites
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
with tobacco. We were not all smokers, but everybody
present assisted in lighting the first pipe, such a
labour was it to keep a match burning. We waited
there in a close bundle until our feet were half frozen
and our faces stiff with icicles. Then we became
rather nervous about our missing friends, and debated
whether they meant to reach the top that day, or
whether they had turned their backs to the lunch
and made for Sprinkling Tarn. The latter course
seemed at once the most expedient for them and the
most convenient for us, and gladly we acted on this
assumption. It was just as well we did so, for the
frost had sharply nipped some of us, and it was long
before my heels gave me any sensation but that of
a pair of snowballs in my boots. We slung round
the Esk Hause, and had some fine glissading to the
hollow of the hill below the crags.</p>

<p>When well opposite our climb at the point whence
we had started some five hours earlier, our united
shouting brought back an answering call from the
gully. Soon we could see the burly form of their
greatest member slowly descending the crags at about
the same spot where we had long before left him.
Having distinguished him as a preliminary landmark
easy of recognition, the three others were one by one
made out. We were relieved to observe that they
were all coming down in a normal condition; no
broken limb or sprained ankle had occurred to spoil
their pleasure and stop their climbing. After a few
minutes’ waiting we learnt their story. The left-hand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
route had begun in a vertical ice-sheet twenty
feet high that took them two hours to surmount.
Then, when with sighs of relief, or hyperbolic
language, or eloquent silence, that marked each
individual’s satisfaction at the happy completion of
a difficult pitch, they had cut their way over the
edge of this wall and rounded the traverse that
dominated it, they were aghast to meet a wall of ice
in every respect similar to the first, but magnified!
This was heart-breaking, but they made a bold bid
for success, and started afresh on the new task. But
the daylight was already within an hour of vanishing,
and a night on those rocks would have been too
much for even the sturdiest of them.</p>

<p>So with a wisdom not often met with in such
cases where an element of competition enters into the
day’s work, they resolved to retire and join us below.
There we met again, and they received their lunch.
I was censured to a slight extent, but blame is
pretty sure to be the portion of him who carries the
provisions. He that shoulders the bag is a responsible
individual, and the condition of good training
that it induces is moral as well as physical.</p>

<p>Then let me insist on the value of such physical
training. The photographer who takes his camera to
the High Alps is often too fond of his apparatus to
give it up to a guide or porter; he frequently decides
hurriedly to take a shot, and soon learns that it is
best to carry all for himself. Economy may often
preach the same precept. Now to lift his own weight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
is a labour he at first fancies will tax all his strength,
but a little practice in carrying a well constructed
and well packed rücksack on small expeditions
will teach him something different. The weight of
the whole equipment for half-plate photography&mdash;camera,
three lenses, tripod, and other accessories&mdash;is
so small a fraction of his own weight that its mere lift
is a negligible consideration. His pace will be diminished
and his back often uncomfortably heated. But
supposing the burden well arranged, many a climber
could habituate himself to it. One of our greatest
Alpine climbers is said to train in Cumberland by
carrying a rücksack filled with stones. Without
attempting to persuade any one but a geologist so to
burden himself on principle, I strongly advise the
man who hopes ultimately to climb without guides
to get early into the habit of carrying loads on
smaller ascents. It will always be a joy to travel free
when occasional opportunity offers, and then he will
assuredly improve his pace. On a really stiff pitch
the sack may have to be raised independently by the
rope, a cause of serious delay when the rope is rigid
with frost and the party inexperienced in tying
knots or reliable loops. It should be remembered
that the sack has more than once protected the
climber from serious injury by falling stones, and that
a pound or two of extra luggage carried up to an
Alpine hut may mean all the difference between a
night of misery and a comfortable rest before an
arduous expedition.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>I have mentioned that the middle route up the
Central Gully leads by easy stages to the upper
portion of the right-hand branch. Some three years
ago a strong party effected an ascent of the chimney
that points directly up to the top of the cliff from the
high ledge between the two routes. We found the
main difficulty was in traversing over an open slab on
the right of the foot of the chimney. The slab was split
by a narrow fissure, but the handholds were slight and
rather insecure. To have trusted to one alone would
have been dangerous, and I recall with amusement
the spread-eagle attitude of the leader as he endeavoured
to distribute his weight equally on four
rickety points of support. The position was good
enough in itself, but to move involved a dangerous
increase in the stress on one of the supports. Fortunately
the second on the rope was able to offer an
axe-head as additional security, and the passage
to the left was effected in safety. The chimney was
narrow and its sides smooth, but with the exception
of a loose stone near the finish, which rattled down
and tended to disturb our wedging, nothing seriously
interfered with our advance.</p>

<p>But there was one amongst us who, in expectation
of falling stones, had thrust his head and shoulders into
the little cave at the foot of the chimney. When the
leader shouted to him he did not hear, and the accompanying
pull on the rope resulted in the hitching of
his shoulders firmly in the cleft and the elevation of his
legs only. The previous evening we had been having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
a heated discussion as to the futility of naming the
sides of a gully or cave after the manner of the banks
of a river&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> of calling the ‘true’ right side of
a gully its left and <i>vice-versâ</i>. Professor M., who
was with us now, had been a listener to the discussion.
Looking down from the top of the chimney
and observing the unusual method of our friend’s
ascent, he called out, ‘It’s all right, Jones, he is
coming up well enough&mdash;the “true up.”’</p>

<p><span class="large2">South-east Gully.</span>&mdash;This in summer time can
often be accomplished in half an hour if the climbers
are few and in a hurry. Before December, 1896, I
had not made a winter ascent; moreover, I had forgotten
much of the detail. Thinking of climbing
notes, I persuaded a small Christmas party to join me
in exploring the gully under these new conditions.</p>

<p>We were only a band of three ultimately, though
at Kern Knotts, which we visited <i>en route</i>, our
number was considerably larger. The other two
were both experienced Alpine climbers, one a very
tall man, the other very short. I was anxious to
determine the advantages and disadvantages of size
and weight, and to that end took the lead myself
and placed the tall man second on the rope. We
had but little wind, and the temperature was slightly
above freezing-point.</p>

<p>The climbing began almost at once, for in five
minutes from the foot the gully walls were close
together and were encrusted with thawing ice. The
narrow bed was broken up into easy pitches, but to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
avoid the stream of water that came down beneath
the soft covering of snow it was necessary to use
small ledges on either side, and span the gully like
diminutive colossi&mdash;here I am referring only to myself
and the little one. Now and again we would
plunge up the gully for a short distance in loose
snow. Occasionally the crystals became more compact,
and two of us could manage to creep over its
surface without slipping through. Rarely was this
the case with our middle man&mdash;a sixteen-stone
Teuton with a scientific training. If snow could be
crushed he crushed it. He became so indifferent in
the matter after awhile, that he made no attempt to
distribute his weight evenly over the surface according
to the rules laid down by Badminton. The little
one, coming last, naturally suffered by this indifference,
and was plaintive over what he called the
‘fallacy of the undistributed middle.’</p>

<p>The first pitch of any size occurred within 200
feet of the foot of the gully, a perfectly vertical rise
of twenty feet in the bed level with a slender waterfall
interfering with our direct progress. The retaining
walls were the least bit too far apart for the
utilization of both simultaneously, and the right side
commended itself to us as the easier to attack. Our
only trouble again was the glaze on the rocks, a
black, shiny veneer too thin for axe operations, too
thick to be trifled with. Such ice always interferes
more with the hands than with the feet, for sharp
boot nails can roughen the surface of an ice ledge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
enough for a foothold, whereas the hands can make
no impression. If the ice is very cold, gloves must
be worn as a protection against the frost. They
have the merit of adhering slightly to the ice when
pressed, and often in that way give the climber
a safe-enough grip. With wet ice such regelation
will not occur, and if the work is hazardous I prefer
to climb with free hands, trusting to friction to
restore circulation wherever an ‘easy’ may be
called.</p>

<p>Making slowly up this wall to a snowy ledge at
the top level of the pitch, I called on the others to
follow, and then worked back into the gully. Here
we found ourselves facing the ‘divide,’ a high and
narrow rib of rock that cut down into the gully and
gave us a choice of routes. Our way lay up to the
right, which a distant view from Sprinkling Tarn
had shown us to be really the main line. The other
branch ends somewhat abruptly out on the face, and
involves a traverse into the main again. A few
yards further up, and a very imposing pitch rose
before us. It was in three portions, the gap between
the second and the third blocked by a huge stone
that bridged the gully. As on the lower fall, so
here the water kept us off the centre-line of the
ravine, and drove us to seek diversion on the right.
On the first part we had the difficulty of snow and
wet ice. Without comment I noticed the little one
carefully wipe out a handhold with his handkerchief
when it was his turn to mount. By the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
manœuvre he had some three years before shown me
how to scramble up a small boulder in the Engelberg
valley that I was forced to admit I could not climb.
It was interesting to observe how little space he
needed for his fingers. On a wall with diminutive
ledges that might easily pass unnoticed, he could
show us all what ‘walking up’ a face of rock really
meant, though his short reach naturally handicapped
him now and again very seriously. I believe a short
man generally does best on rocks. His hands are
as a rule stronger in proportion to his weight. The
long climber can reach further but is often unable to
utilize the distant grip to which he has stretched, if it
is small or badly rounded. Moreover, he often finds
himself in the attitude of a looping caterpillar, a pose
that demands a firmer handgrip and that rapidly
exhausts the muscles.</p>

<p>We all reached the first ledge safely. Then came
the passage of the bridge. If we passed under it we
should get terribly wet and cold, though there would
be no particular difficulty in getting through to the
final chimney. Every inch of the boulder was glazed,
and it offered very few excrescences to hang upon.
But it had the making of an edge at its crest, and I
gradually worked up the outside till I could reach
this and pull up. There is one advantage of a glaze&mdash;possibly
its only one&mdash;it offers no friction to one’s
body in an arm-pull.</p>

<p>Thence it was an easy step over to the final
chimney. A small spout of water as thick as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
one’s wrist was jetting from the top against the
right wall, and we were inevitably in for a wetting
in spite of the circumvention of the bridge. I
essayed to finish the pitch before the others started
from their ledge twenty feet below. A fairly good
lodgment for the right foot was utilized and passed.
The body had to be jammed across the chimney, the
fingers seeking for a crevice high up on the right
wall. When a slab is streaming with water and
handholds can be found within easy reach, it is a
good plan to keep ‘thumbs down’ as much as
possible; for then the water will drain off by the
thumbs, and run clear of the coat-sleeves. The
strain is too great to operate in this way with arms
at full length above the head. That was manifest in my
trouble on the wall. The ice-cold water trickled down
my arms and body, making me wet through in a
few moments. But the horror of it came with the
realization that I was unable to move backwards or
forwards. The situation was almost critical, but not
an unusual one for winter climbing in Cumberland.
I could at any rate give it my cool consideration,
and decide whether to call up the big one to help
me or to try an independent descent. The men
below saw me in trouble and made a move upwards
towards the pitch. Then it occurred to me that
the big one would not be able to force a way under
the bridge, and that he might be a long time working
over it, longer than I could manage to hold out.
That decided me, and I started wriggling downwards.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
Luckily the hands were not yet benumbed, and by
entire disregard of the main water-supply down the
central line of flow, which now included the back
of my neck, I managed to reach the platform again.
Until my second came up it was useless to make
another attempt, and indeed it was now eminently
desirable that everybody should get wet. I am not
an advocate for monopoly in such cases. With
some slight inducement suggested by the rope, the
big one pulled himself over the bridge and came up
to the platform. Here he was invited to hold himself
firmly against the wall, and give me his shoulders
and head for elevating purposes. He was immediately
drenched before I had effected a start up his mighty
back, but there was a sense of perfect security now;
it would be impossible to fall past him. As for
the effect of cold and wet on him, we could neglect
so small a consideration. In any case he would not
feel it till the trouble was over. I thought of the
old dynamics problem beginning: ‘Let a fly of mass
m be crawling up the trunk of an elephant, whose
mass may be neglected,’ and realized for the first time
that there was some sense in the quaint hypothesis.
Once on his shoulders I reached up to a dry ledge,
dragged myself on to it, and thence strode across to
the top of the pitch.</p>

<p>The third man had managed to reach the
platform during these operations, and now nobly
offered his little all as a foothold for the giant. My
heart sank when I heard it graciously accepted, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
it rested with me to share the responsibility and let
the rope take up some of the stress. The big one
came up grandly with these small aids, and we
hurried the little one to send along my camera
sack and then himself. This pitch was the hardest
part of the day’s work, and showed itself to vary
much with existing circumstances. I can just
remember enough of a former expedition to add that
it needs care in summer time, though it cannot,
rightly speaking, be called difficult.</p>

<p>We then went upwards again over snow at a
gentle angle till the third pitch was reached. This
was of a simple design, just a cave formed by a fallen
boulder, and no doubt it could be taken in many
ways. We climbed up a six-feet wall on the right
from the entrance to the cave, and scrambled easily
into the snow-bed beyond. Thence to the top was a
matter of only ten minutes, the single hindrance
being a pile of boulders that were climbed by an easy
tunnel that led to the crest of the left-hand wall of
the gully. We walked out at the top just as twilight
set in, after some two hours’ gentle excitement. We
were naturally still damp, and felt no inclination to
stay about on the ridge, so hurrying round towards
Esk Hause we glissaded rapidly to the path and
walked home.</p>

<p>The left-hand variation in the gully is often
taken, but is scarcely as interesting. Just after
passing the divide we find another buttress of rock
cutting the gully into two sections. Here the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
buttress is not much thicker than an ordinary brick
wall; it is sometimes called the ‘curtain.’ There
are pitches on each side of it, that on the right being
more definite and more interesting. It leads up a
steep chimney to the crest of the curtain, which is
crossed to the left. The climber is then in the
left-hand branch, and has no difficulty in ascending
the gully till it dwindles down to nothing, and he
finds himself looking into the main south-east gully
just above the third pitch. It will be best, then, to
climb down and finish by the usual route.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Cust’s Gully.</span>&mdash;The climbing in this is of the
slightest character in summer time, there being but
one short pitch beneath the natural arch, and very
little in that. But with hard snow about there is
scarcely a pleasanter way of playing at Alpine
climbing above the snow-line than by taking Great
End viâ Skew Ghyll and Cust’s Gully. The snow
slope will alter in inclination from about 30° at the
bottom to 70° at the top. If the pitch is but thinly
covered, there is the fun of tackling a pitfall, and of
bringing to bear on the safe crossing all the science
that glacier crevasses may have taught us in
Switzerland. Nor let any think that it is all make-believe
and that of difficulty there is none. I have
had grand times in Cust’s Gully, where we were
actually tired out with the labour of cutting steps.
The snow when fresh is soft and yielding. Give it a
week or two to settle down, and it will bind together
so as to offer firm support on scraped footholds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
But let cold rain fall on hard snow and the temperature
then fall below freezing-point, the surface will
become icy and every step will require careful
making. Then should the picturesque attitudes of
step-cutting depicted in Badminton be imitated in
all seriousness, and the axe wielded with the scientific
swing. It has happened more than once that a bad
axe has proved its worthlessness when tested on the
Cumbrian fells in a winter expedition&mdash;a much less
dangerous discovery than if it were taken new to
the Alps and there found wanting. The difficulty in
the latter case is that our axes are so rarely used
for hard work, if we are led up the great peaks by
competent guides. They delight in removing every
obstacle in our way, and it may be that long usage
of the axe has really been but a test of the <i>bâton</i>,
not at all of the pick. Then comes a time when the
leading weapon is broken, or carelessly dropped, or
still more carelessly pitched up to a ledge of only
suppositious safety. Do not imagine that these
things never happen, for each has been within my
own experience during the last three years; and woe
to the party if the untested axe is a weakling when
emergency calls on it!</p>

<p>The upper part of Cust’s Gully when the snow is
at its hardest may almost be regarded as a test of
nerve for the novice. I once was starting to cut
down the gully in such a state, with a young man of
limited Alpine knowledge, who diffidently suggested
that step-cutting was rather slow and that he would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
prefer a glissade if I did not mind. I shuddered at
the vision his naïve suggestion conjured up, of a
species of chain-shot shooting viciously down the
tremendously steep slope, ricochetting from wall to
wall of the gully, and scraped very bare by the sharp-toothed
icy surface. That novice had no nerves,
and my remarks are not intended for him. The
contention is that an amateur party cutting up the
steepening slope, and forging a way through an
incipient cornice of overhanging frost crystals at the
top, will learn much of the genuine safety of an ice-slope,
and will see how to divest it of its imaginary
dangers. There are many Alpine climbers positively
afraid of harmless slopes, that are not nearly so bad
as they appear, and still less formidable than they
show up in photographs. Such men have never led
up steep snow.</p>

<p>Near the foot of Cust’s Gully a branch passes up
to the right, of less altitude and gentler inclination;
its rock scenery is not so fine, and the place is rarely
visited.

<span class="large"><i>GREAT GABLE. THE ENNERDALE FACE AND
THE OBLIQUE CHIMNEY.</i></span></h2>

<p>Great Gable takes high rank among the hills
of Britain for grace of form and for the beauty of
the views it offers to the climber. It is a square
pyramid in shape, and shows nearly its full height
(2,949 feet) from the Wastdale level. It stands at
the head of the valley, and when seen from the
shores of the lake appears completely to shut off the
valley from all approach by the north end. Its four
main ridges offer fairly easy walking to the summit.
The north-east ridge runs down towards Green
Gable, Brandreth, Grey Knotts, and the Honister
pass, a little <i>col</i> marking the lowest point (2,400 feet)
between the peak and Green Gable. A moderate
path leads the pedestrian from Borrowdale up by
way of Aaron Slack towards this little pass, which is
known as Wind Gap, and then bears up towards
Great Gable. The pass may be crossed into Ennerdale
and a rough descent taken to the Liza stream.</p>

<p>The north-west ridge leads down towards Kirkfell.
The broad depression between the two
mountains is known as Beckhead (2,000 feet). It is
often marshy in the neighbourhood of the diminutive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
Beckhead Tarn. A wire fence that adorns the
summit-ridge from Kirkfell can be followed for some
distance up Gable. Thence to the summit is somewhat
craggy, but not difficult for pedestrians.</p>

<p class="small">(<i>Face page 114</i>)</p></div>

<p>The south-west ridge is called the Gavel Neese
(Gable Nose), showing from Wastdale Head as a
rounded grassy shoulder leading directly towards
the peak. Up this shoulder we may make the
shortest ascent of Gable from Wastdale, avoiding the
easy crags of White Napes that face us where the
upper limit of the grass is passed, by skirting round
the screes on the left. An ancient path with the
strange name of Moses’ Sledgate leads up Gavel
Neese till the level of Beckhead is nearly reached,
and then bears away on a traverse over the screes
round to the middle of the Ennerdale side of the
mountain, there to lose itself in the wilderness of
stones that are bestrewn all over that desolate
region.</p>

<p>The remaining ridge to the south-east is scarcely
definite enough to be worthy the name, though from
Wastdale it seems to be at least as well marked as
Gavel Neese. It leads towards the Styhead pass
(1,579 feet) and offers a quick route to the top. Mr.
Haskett Smith suggests ‘half an hour’s rough walking,’
but that pace is too severe for most walkers.</p>

<p>Of the four faces of the pyramid the north and
south are precipitous, the west offers very little
scope for the cragsman’s skill, and the east absolutely
none. The north or Ennerdale face is practically
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
a single, exposed section of some 400 feet of
rock, seamed with traverses and split with numerous
gullies and chimneys. The south face is of a complicated
design. Springing up from the 2,000-feet
level, the Great Napes appears in the centre of the
south face as a great rock screen belonging to the
main mass of Gable. In reality it is well separated
off by deep hollows cutting behind it to right and
left. The highest point of the Napes is connected
with the upper crags of Gable by the crest separating
these two hollows, either of which may be
followed down in safety by benighted wanderers who
are past all wish to avoid screes, and whose one desire
is to reach a low level in some inhabited valley.</p>

<p>Let us more happily suppose for the present that
we are upward bound and desirous of circumventing
Great Napes. We can observe from Wastdale Head
the line of lighter scree that comes down either side
of the Napes. That to the left leads through a
beautiful natural gateway between White Napes and
Great Napes, and thence trends to the right up to
the summit ridge connecting the latter to the final
crags of Gable. The streak of reddish scree to the
east leads up through larger portals into the very
heart of the mountain, penetrating round to the
back of the Napes, and thence up by the left to the
same summit ridge. This hollow is floored with
small red scree that glows with a marvellous richness
of colour in the sunlight.</p>

<p>The passage between the foot of the Napes and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
a rock pinnacle at the entrance to the hollow is
called Hell Gate. Philologists may be led to connect
the name with the colour of the scree, for the primitive
mind of the namer would have naturally associated
redness with an infernal intensity of heat. The
White Napes offers a little scrambling, but the Great
Napes precipice gives us the best climbing to be had
on the Gable; and if, after reaching the crest of this
wall, we bear slightly downwards across the upper
part of Hell Gate screes, we can finish our climbing
by some excellent rocks that lead to the large Westmorland
cairn close to the highest point of the mountain.
These Westmorland crags, as we presently
find it convenient to name them, are irregularly continued
away towards the south-east and the Styhead
pass, by Tom Blue, Raven Crag, and Kern Knotts.
The last named are in two tiers, the lower being
close to the Styhead path, and only some 1,200 feet
above Wastdale Head. The upper Kern Knotts offer
climbing of great interest and perhaps exceptional
severity, and are rapidly becoming popular among
the climbing fraternity.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Ennerdale Face.</span>&mdash;Looking first to the
north side of Gable it is a matter of regret that no
satisfactory inclusive view may be obtained of the
whole width of this mountain wall. Seen from the
slopes of Kirkfell the face recedes in such a way that
very little of its climbing can be prospected. From
the ridge between Scarth Gap and Brandreth we
have a front view of the crags, but they are much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
dwarfed by distance, and their northern aspect is
unsuitable for long range photography.</p>

<p>From Kirkfell we can readily mark the Oblique
Chimney which cuts deeply into the upper half of the
centre of the face, and terminates at a right-angled
notch in the sky-line. Some distance to the right we
may with a good light identify the Great Central
Gully that cuts the face from top to bottom. To the
immediate right of this is an easy scree leading
the whole way to the top of the crags. Near the
foot of this on the right there used to be a slab
pinnacle some fifteen feet in height that has since been
completely disintegrated by rain and frost. A year
or two ago the freshly exposed rock that bore witness
of the recent departure of the pinnacle could be
clearly recognised by contrast with the older face.
This climb is now reported to have been exceedingly
difficult; such will probably be the future reputation
of the fast disappearing Stirrup Crag on Yewbarrow.
A little higher up this scree slope, on a small platform
out to the left, the remains of an old stone-walled
enclosure could once be distinguished. It
may have been the haunt of whisky smugglers or the
hiding place of some miserable outlaw. It is to be
regretted that the remains are now in too bad a state
of repair to be recognised as artificial. Between the
Oblique Chimney and the Central Gully lies the easy
route or natural passage by which a mountain sheep
of ordinary powers ‘might ascend’; though it not infrequently
occurs that the perplexed climber roundly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
declares that the mountain sheep of average mental
capacity is not so foolish as to venture into such
a bewildering region of small grass traverses, steep
stony slopes, and ledgeless walls.</p>

<p>Immediately to the left of the Oblique Chimney is
the climb that leads past the Bottle-shaped Pinnacle
and up the huge retaining buttress of the chimney.
Further towards Wind Gap the sky-line suddenly
drops at the upper level of Stony Gully&mdash;an easy,
though rough, passage up broken boulders and loose
scree, by which the crags can be outflanked. The
wire fence that leads over Wind Gap to Green
Gable and Brandreth begins here, and is a useful
landmark in misty weather. Mr. Haskett Smith
found in 1882 a ‘high level route’ across the face at
about two-thirds of the way up. It is an excellent
ramble, and full of strange surprises, passing along
exposed ledges, in between towers of rock and the
great upper wall, offering a peep into the black
recess of the Oblique Chimney, and an easy digression
up to the Bottle-shaped Pinnacle. It finishes
close to the foot of Stony Gully, and can be recommended
for a preliminary survey of the more difficult
routes up the Ennerdale face.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Oblique Chimney.</span>&mdash;From a few notes added
to a sketch of the known routes up the Ennerdale face,
which Mr. John Robinson inserted in the Wastdale
Climbing Book, April, 1890, I derived my first impressions
of the Oblique Chimney: ‘This has, I believe, not
yet been climbed and is not very safe, owing to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
jammed stones in it being loose, and the clean-cut
walls on each side making these stones of consequence.’
This description was realistic though brief,
but I thought little of the place till the Christmas
vacation of 1892-3, when I learnt that Mr. R. C.
Gilson had proposed to attack the chimney one fine
day, but was forestalled by Dr. Collier’s party. These
latter took the precautionary measure of partly
descending the chimney, so as to clear away the
<i>débris</i> and loose stones that hovered over the edge
of each pitch; they then returned to the foot of the
chimney and forced a way directly up to the top.
The important jammed stones required for the middle
portion were quite firm enough for safe holding, and
the party returned with a fuller praise of the beauties
of the chimney than any one had anticipated.
I was given an account of the expedition a day or
two later, and was glad enough to get the opportunity
of trying conclusions with the crags on that
side of Gable, which till then was unexplored
country for me.</p>

<p>My companion that Christmas was a learned
classic, weary of brain work, whom I had induced
to take a little climbing in Cumberland as a tonic.
Some people cannot take quinine, others apparently
cannot benefit by rock-climbing. This latter I found
to be the case with my friend, whose struggle with
the <i>confracti rudera mundi</i> made him despondent
instead of inducing a healthy exhilaration. The
sore limbs and torn clothing he never seemed able to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
forget, far less to enjoy. Yet the ruling passion of
phrase-making was strong even <i>in extremis</i>, and he
longed to put his sufferings into words. Sometimes
on the rocks I might casually turn to see that he was
coming up well. His eyes would be gazing at
nothing and his lips moving as if in prayer. But it
was not prayer, it was a Greek or Latin quotation,
preferably the former because of its rich vocabulary
for description of scenery. On the whole he was
enjoying the new experiences hugely in his own
melancholy way, and I felt no compunction in insisting
on his joining K. and A. when we planned
our excursion up Gable by way of the Oblique
Chimney. The day was rather cloudy and snow
threatened, but we took plenty of provisions, and K.
carried a pocket compass. We started somewhat
late in the morning, and walked leisurely up Gavel
Neese and round the Beckhead by way of Moses’
Sledgate. But on reaching the wire fence we found
that the mist completely enveloped the Gable crags
and gave us no chance of identifying our climb from
below. Then we skirted along the base in the vain
hope of a momentary disclosure of the chimney by
a parting of the mist, but no such chance offered,
and we reached Stony Gully without making a
start up. Here we saw the ‘rake’ or traverse
that has been described as passing along the
face about two-thirds of the way up. It was an obvious
course to take, inasmuch as it led to within a
few feet of the foot of the Oblique Chimney&mdash;so near
that even the dense mist could scarcely prevent our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
striking it. Here the classic assured us that he would
much prefer ascending by Stony Gully to the top of
Gable, and that it would give him extreme pleasure
to carry our lunch up to the cairn and wait for us
there. We let him go, and promised that we should
join him again by three o’clock in the afternoon.
Thus did we lose our lunch, not to find it again for
another week. There was much ice and fresh snow
plastering the rocks, and the so-called ‘easy’ traverse
wanted all our care. K. was an expert Alpine
climber, his friend A. a plucky young Harrovian with
plenty of nerve and endurance in him, but at that
time with next to nothing in the way of experience
of the mountains. He came along well enough, but
our pace was necessarily very slow. Three o’clock
found us still working westwards on the traverse,
but without a sight of the Oblique Chimney. I think
in one place we must have descended too much. At
any rate, we found ourselves in difficulties on a
sloping slab of glazed rock that gave me serious
pause. A. slipped on this, and started slithering
away rapidly. Luckily he held his axe tightly, and
was brought up by the rope with a jerk. Shortly
after this, he pointed to some blood on the rocks,
and solicitously asked me whether I had cut myself
very badly. It turned out, after a hasty glance at
my hands, that he himself was the wounded one.
My little complaint was a slight frostbite in the
finger-tips, my gloves having been worn threadbare
by much scraping with the hands.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>At last we reached a pinnacle that promised us
variety. We tried to climb up it by the outside edge,
but found the ice too troublesome. Then, when
resting on the shoulder half way up, we saw a deep
and narrow cavern in the mountain wall behind the
pinnacle. Surely that must be the object of our quest
and our pinnacle the redoubtable ‘bottle-shaped.’
Eagerly we scrambled over the shoulder and down
a slight gully on to the scree that issues from the
mouth of the cavern. It was getting dark, and we
were very hungry. My jacket pocket still held the
crumbs of a pulverized biscuit that I had taken up
Snowdon the week before. These and a fragment of
chocolate we scrupulously shared, and then began
the attack in earnest. The conditions had much
changed since Dr. Collier had effected his ascent, and
though the gully overhangs too much to permit any
drift snow to settle in it, the smooth walls of the
gully were black and shiny with ice, and the damp
cold of this dark hole tried our endurance to the
utmost. It must be admitted that my ascent of the
first part was slow and ungraceful. I had started
with my back resting against the left wall, bracing
my feet as firmly as the ice would permit against the
diminutive knobs on the opposite side. Now in this
position the back cannot be worked up an overhanging
wall unless the hands have something definite
to thrust against. The process went on fairly well
for about twenty-five feet, working outwards as well
as upwards, but then the two sides of the chimney
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
became perilously far apart and the smooth left wall
commenced to overhang.</p>

<p>Then ensued a few moments of awkward suspense,
an uncertainty as to the best method of transferring
one’s weight to certain small ledges against which
the feet were now pressing.</p>

<p>The process of ‘backing up’ is excessively
fatiguing, the thrust necessary to hold oneself firmly
<i>in situ</i> being as a rule much greater than the equivalent
of one’s weight, and the whole of this thrust
being at every slight lift transmitted through the
arms. He who fails to realize the attitude I am
describing may easily perform an experiment that
illustrates the mechanical principles involved, by
sitting down across a doorway or narrow passage,
and attempting to work upwards by pressure of the
feet against one side and back against the other. If,
when some three feet from the ground, he waits a
minute or two and then attempts to move again,
either up or down, he will perceive that the simple
holding in place has tired his muscles and made
advance or retreat equally difficult.</p>

<p>Our doorway had already extended up for twenty-five
feet and yet another five remained before a
comfortable halting-place could be reached. The
cleft forming the chimney was so much undercut
that the view vertically downwards included the
scree some distance below the entrance to the
cavern, and anything that I might have let fall,
myself for instance, would have dropped some feet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
further out than the two men waiting below. The
halt was a mistake; there was only one course open,
and that should have been taken at first. It was
to work inwards until the doubtful jammed stones
could be reached with the left hand, and then,
trusting mainly to the footholds, hoist the body over
to that side of the gully and thrust the hand into
the recesses between the stones. K. shouted up
some suggestion to this effect from below. How he
managed to discern the proper place through the dim
twilight I never was able to ascertain. But I resolved
to try it, and in some strange way the cramped
muscles that had appeared incapable of further effort
were in a second or two relieved by the change of
attitude, and the pull over to the right side that I had
dreaded as the severest tax on my strength proved to
be easy enough. With fists in two convenient little
holes clenched to prevent the hands slipping out, I
was able to take a momentary survey of the slightly
rickety ladder of jammed stones that led to safety.
The passage of these few feet was not at all pleasant.
Had ours been the first climb of the chimney we
might have reasonably decided to brave the perils of
descent and return again by daylight, rather than
fumble about in the dusk pawing at wabbly boulders
that threatened to fall out with us at even a caress,
much more promptly at a cross word.</p>

<p>But the knowledge that others had tried them,
and had learnt the futility of these threats, gave me
some degree of courage, and, taking heart of grace, I,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
walked up the ladder and out of the first great
difficulty. A. came up next, and as the hour was
late and we were all a little anxious to finish, he did
not scorn to use the rope at the bad corner just
below the ladder. K. came up remarkably well,
and I felt that if he had led us we should have
mastered the pitch earlier.</p>

<p>We were now able to walk towards the roof of
the upper portion of the gully, which was as completely
closed in as the cave below. The left wall
everywhere overhung so much that there was no
chance of climbing out by its aid. The right wall
was nearly parallel to the left and showed a few
more possibilities.</p>

<p>Looking backwards we could see the two walls
projecting several yards out, apparently a little
nearer together at their extreme edges than they
were in our upper chamber, which was now much too
wide for any opportunity of backing up. But we
knew that the second pitch was not so bad as the
first, and started prospecting. I crept up as high
into the cave as possible, and then felt round the
edge of the roof for a firm hold. This came to hand
almost at once, and with a step out on to the sloping
wall, and probably a steadying hand from below, I
worked up between the roof-stone and the right side.
This led to a steep little snow-slope, evidently covering
loose stones that might prove excitable in dry
weather, and thence a few yards of broken rock
extended to the summit of the crags.

<p class="caption">THE ENNERDALE FACE OF GREAT GABLE</p></div>

<p>In five minutes we had assembled there, and
decided that we were still distressingly hungry. I
felt in my pocket for more crumbs, but only brought
out stones. We hurried up to the cairn at the
highest point of the mountain. It looked a picture
of Alpine solitude. Not a trace of the classic, no
hope of our lunch. Fresh snow had fallen during the
last hour or two, and had obliterated all signs of his
visit. Nay, worse, we had not that implicit confidence
in his knowledge of the district to feel certain
that he had found his way safely down to Wastdale,
for he had never been on the mountain before; nor
was he quite so familiar with the mountain mists as
we proud climbers of the Oblique Chimney. But he
had the laugh of us that night! We expressed
sorrow for the poor man, and then with a sigh turned
to consider our own position. It was a trifle unpleasant
to be on the summit of Great Gable after
six p.m. on a snowy winter’s night, with something
of a wind blowing through us and very little to
obstruct its free passage. But for all that we were
happy enough, and arranged elaborately to steer by
compass direct for White Napes and Gavel Neese.
South-west by west was our direction. K. was
positive of that fact, and offered to lead. Some
twenty yards behind him came young A., still going
well; then I followed at an equal distance behind
him, just able by the reflected light from the snow to
distinguish the leader and keep him in the straight
line he was marking out for us.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<p>By the light of a match that we kept flaming for
a sufficient time in an improvised tent of coats, he
examined the pocket compass he carried, and was
confident that ten minutes’ good going would carry
us down to the grassy shoulder below the White
Napes. On we went steadily downwards, and I
wondered whether, if we took to running when the
boulders were passed, we might get down in time to
start dinner at the usual hour. Happy thoughts in
this connection kept me from attending particularly
to our route and its details, but when we got to a
thicker mist I looked about for a landmark. Nothing
could be recognised. The ground sloped rapidly
down on the right; the left seemed to rise most
oddly to a sort of ridge. But the strange thing was
that there seemed to be another mountain fronting us.
K. was at a complete loss, and took out his compass
again. We erected the tent once more, and all
crowded over the instrument to determine our fate.
Alas, we had been travelling towards the north! K.
had mistaken the two poles of the magnet. The
mountain mass looming ahead was the Green Gable,
and we were within a few feet of the Wind Gap. Our
dinner was at least two hours further away than ever,
and we were still hungry. There was nothing to be
done but walk round the mountain by way of the Styhead
tarn and pass. We had no lantern, and it would
have been a legbreaking business to attempt to skirt
the Ennerdale face and strike off the Moses’ Sledgate
in the dark. The snow was soft all the way down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
Aaron Slack. I have often come down in daylight
since and wondered what we could have found to
tumble over that night; we were always slipping
through snow pitfalls into water, or tripping over
boulders and on to our heads in snowdrifts. Now
and again we would find ourselves sitting side by
side in the stream, the leader’s tumbling having been
too sudden to permit of any warning to the others.
Such occasions we generally seized on as suitable
opportunities for halting, only to be ended by sleepy
realization that the water was both damp and cold.
And all the time the inexperienced classic was enjoying
his dinner and his phrase-making in princely
luxury and comfort at the inn.</p>

<p>At last we reached the shores of the frozen tarn
and turned wearily up to the right. The path was
in a shocking state, and on arriving at the cairn at
the top of the pass we found a continuous glaze of ice
along our route. So, at any rate, it seemed to be
that night&mdash;my first experience of crossing the Styhead
in the dark. It was nothing less than actual
hand-and-foot work in many an awkward corner.
Subsequent opportunities of climbing down the path
in the dark have often been given me, but that
first night was the worst. How we managed to
avoid broken limbs has ever been a mystery. We
would suddenly slip over on the ice, and slide
furiously down the path and into some obstruction
below. We had tried to smoke, but pipes were too
dangerous to hold between the teeth during these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
unpremeditated rushes. But time ends all things. By
ten o’clock we were anointed with Vaseline and
massaged with Elliman, with the prospect of substantial
fare to follow. The classic slippered into the
dining-room to report himself. He had waited on
Gable cairn till half-past three, and then had returned
by the way he had come. Our lunch he had
left under a stone, and as a guide to our finding it
had stamped the snow down and drawn with his
finger several arrows or asterisks or other marks
of reference in the snow. It was very clever,
but the fresh fall thwarted his ingenuity only too
effectually.</p>

<p>The Oblique Chimney rapidly became popular,
and has since been visited by many climbers. But
it can never be regarded as an easy ascent.</p>

<p>Some time during the summer following I looked
down it to see how a descent might be managed.
The loose stones at the top were most uncomfortably
unstable, and the clamber down towards the
entrance of the upper cave required great care,
without being exactly perilous. A friend was with
me who counselled waiting till we should find ourselves
up there again with a rope, and ultimately
his advice prevailed. Some eighteen months later,
in January, 1895, a large party of Wastdale Christmas
revellers made for the Oblique Chimney top.
The crags were approached from the scree below,
a few feet to the north of the entrance to the
Central Gully. We took to a little chimney at once,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
and then up a grassy slope to another chimney that
brought us to steep grass and scree with frequent
outcrops of rock.</p>

<p>Thence we made up towards the entrance to the
Oblique Chimney then visible, and before reaching it
clambered up an incipient gully on the left wall that
bounds the scree just there. It led over the sharp
crest of the buttress that supports the bottle-shaped
pinnacle, and thence we had a steep but fairly easy
descent of ten or twelve feet to a ledge that led round
to the other side. The rocks were dry and very
free from snow, so that each member of our party
found himself able to pull up easily from ledge to
ledge in the little gully till the notch between the
pinnacle and the main wall was reached.</p>

<p>Thence the leader turned up to the left, and recommenced
a similar series of ledge-climbing operations,
of which only the first from the notch could be called
in any sense difficult. We had a magnificent view
down the face, which is particularly steep just here,
and the frequent halts rendered necessary by the size
of our party afforded plenty of time to admire the
huge slabs that separated the ‘sheep walk’ from us.
A small stone-man marked our point of arrival at the
summit of the crags, and after adding a block or two
as our contribution to the cairn we turned right, and
in a few yards had reached the rectangular entrance
to the Oblique Chimney.</p>

<p>The main difficulty in the descent was to prevent
stones sliding on to the heads of men lower down,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
who were in the direct line of fire and rarely able
to raise a protecting arm for themselves. The upper
ones were continually cautioned by those in peril to
keep an eye to the rope, and prevent its dragging
over the bed of the gully. All passed down safely,
but I remember making a mistake when descending
the great overhanging pitch at the bottom, in
assuming that it was an easy matter to climb down
with a camera sack on my back. I had descended
part of the ‘ladder,’ but then found the need of a
back pressure, and hesitated about crushing in the
contents of my sack. The rope is of no use to the
last man in a place of that kind, and I therefore was
permitted to untie the knot round my waist and fix
on the sack instead, letting it down gently to the
others by the left hand. The right was needed to
hold on firmly to the ladder, so that the teeth were in
requisition for the tying. The descent offers another
instance of the ease with which a chimney that is
exceptionally severe in the ascent may be traversed
in the reverse direction. Where gravity helps the
motion we have only to consider the best means of
opposing it. During an ascent much strength is
spent in the mere lift, to say nothing of the extra
force needed to prevent slipping.</p>

<p>At the foot we joined up again and traversed
round to the ‘sheep walk.’ This was easy to discover
but hard to describe. The route bore obliquely
upwards towards the right, always well out in the
open, giving us pleasant hand-and-foot work the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
whole way. We reached the top in safety, and then
proceeded homewards by way of White Napes.</p>

<p>Mr. Haskett Smith says that the top of the easy
passage bears 23° east of north when viewed by
prismatic compass from the highest point of Great
Gable. It probably means magnetic north, and the
fact is of value to benighted climbers who know
which end of the compass is the north pole.</p>

<p>On April 3, 1896, a new variation route was
found into the upper cave of the Oblique Chimney
by Messrs. C. and A. Hopkinson and H. Campbell,
who worked up a slightly marked gully in the great
wall to the left of the sheep walk, and then, after an
ascent of fifty feet, traversed round by the left into
the chimney.

<span class="large"><i>THE ENNERDALE CENTRAL GULLY AND TWO
LITTLE CHIMNEYS</i></span></h2>

<p>There is no royal road to learning, and the converse
proposition is equally true. There is no learning
along a royal road. Some years ago I went up
the Central Gully of the Gable behind an experienced
climber, when conditions were at their best. It was
a royal road to me, and I came away with but a
vague notion of its difficulties, without having learnt
anything. It is the leader that can give the truest
description of an easy climb. Where the one man
can do all the work, his followers go up without a
thought beyond their rope’s length. When difficulties
are shared discussion is necessary, and the
memory is assisted by subsequent references to faulty
moves or to troubles that all were instrumental in
overcoming. It is astonishing how few men can
recall the details of a rock climb to the extent of
recapitulating the successive pitches in, say, two
hours of gully work. And yet the faculty is well
worth cultivating, inasmuch as it accentuates the
pleasures of retrospection and may be called into
active service by the inquiries of others wishing to
follow. Indeed the best introduction to guideless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
climbing is to ascend rock peaks that we have afore-time
accomplished with guides in front of us, where
we shall find our memories taxed now and again in
the effort to recall the route taken previously. To
lie in bed and remember every foothold on the
Matterhorn may require more ascents than one; but
however wicked it is for a Zermatt guide to indulge
in such a pastime, the average amateur may well
envy him his accomplishment.</p>

<p>Quite recently I had the opportunity of joining a
party up the Central Gully. We had come over to
Gable Crag after an hour or two on the Eagle’s Nest
<i>arête</i> and the neighbouring rocks. Our plan was
to get up the chief pitches in the gully, and then,
instead of bearing up to the right at the foot of the
final wall, to take to the narrow vertical chimney
that passes up its centre and leads to the highest
point of the crags&mdash;to treat it as an old friend with
a new face.</p>

<p>But before taking to the gully there was another
little chimney to visit, that had been recently ‘invented’
by Dr. Simpson and Mr. Patchell, on their
way to the Great Central. It is a singular thing that
this remarkably interesting way up Gable Crag should
have so long remained undiscovered. The reference
in the Wastdale book is as follows: ‘A walk of a
hundred feet along a grass ledge from the point
where the wire fence from Beckhead touches the
rocks of the Gable, followed by a hundred feet of
scrambling up a wild and much broken gully, leads
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
to a small cairn which marks the foot of a chimney
on the left. This runs up in a direction parallel to
the face of the cliff, and so is not clearly seen except
at close quarters. It is very straight and narrow,
especially in the middle pitch, and makes an
interesting climb of about eighty feet.’</p>

<p>We worked round the scree and broken rock from
the top of the Napes to Gable Crag. Then by keeping
fairly low down we arrived at the end of the wire
fence from Beckhead, and were in a position to profit
by the description already supplied. The fence ends
abruptly on the face of a crag that is somewhat
separated from the main mass of Gable. Between the
two a scree gully runs downwards in the direction
of Brandreth, and the Doctor’s Chimney is found to
spring from a point a hundred feet up from the
foot of this gully. The crag interferes with the view
of the chimney from the neighbourhood of Beckhead,
though from the nearer slopes of Kirkfell the
little climb is almost as well marked as the Oblique
Chimney.</p>

<p>The hand-and-foot work begins on the right side
of the recess, and the climber makes directly up to a
little pinnacle about thirty feet above him. There
is no need to back up the chimney at first. The
pinnacle offers comfortable standing-room for one
only, but the leader can manipulate the rope for the
second until the latter is within a foot or two of the
platform. Then by passing a few coils of rope
round the top of the pinnacle he can make the second
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
safe while he effects the rather awkward passage
back into the crack. Both hands seize an excellent
hold on the opposite wall, perfectly safe but a trifle
remote for a man with a short reach, and then the
foothold is quitted and the body dragged into a good
jamming position. The crack is very narrow, and
extensive slipping is almost an impossibility. It
now becomes necessary to wriggle up inch by inch
with slight hold for the extremities and too much
for intermediate excrescences. A few feet higher
and the chimney is at its narrowest. Here follows
an uncomfortable rearrangement of the system. The
handholds have hitherto been best on the left wall,
and the climber has accordingly faced that way.
But now the holds dwindle down to nothing on that
side and others appear on the right. We may
either climb out of the crack and on to the buttress,
or preferably effect a half-turn of the body and so
get to face the right wall. This is most safely
accomplished by working outwards a bit before
twisting. A small stone is half jammed in the crack
and may be used for a foothold, though too insecure
for any hauling purposes. The struggling now
becomes a little less irregular. The ledges are
excellent for the hands, and in a few feet we reach
the level of the floor of a little cave roofed in by a
couple of overhanging blocks. This place again is
only large enough for one cave-dweller to inhabit,
and the leader has his choice of procedure&mdash;either
to run out another twelve feet before the second
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
man comes up, or to wait till his follower reaches the
narrowest part of the crack. To avoid the trouble
of re-arranging the rope, the latter plan is better,
though it involves a little risk of peppering the crack
man with small stones that are only too willing to
lower their present level at the roof of the cave.</p>

<p>The last move is moderately easy. By pulling
up on to the horizontal ledge on the left buttress the
loose stones are almost avoided, and then some easy
steps land the leader in safety a few yards from the
upper edge of the crags. When all are up, a traverse
of about fifty yards to the right discloses a rough
but quick route down to the scree gully and the
wire fence, or the same traverse continued along the
contour-line leads to the Westmorland crags and
the beginning of the ordinary scree descent towards
Gavel Neese.</p>

<p>The Doctor’s Chimney deserves to be popular.
It is a perfectly safe climb, and offers excellent practice
for the arms. On the whole it is probably a
little easier than the Oblique Chimney, especially
when descended, for it is so narrow that there is
little need to seek footholds until the level of the
pinnacle is reached. It has the advantage over its
more famous rival of being easily hit off in misty
weather; for a scree gully is then less mistakable
than a rocky sheep walk, and a wire fence than a
‘bottle-shaped’ pinnacle.</p>

<p>Such, then, was our digression before making for
the foot of the Central Gully. Another party of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
friends had comfortably ensconced themselves in
various corners on the small crag opposite the chimney,
and were interested observers of our performance.
They smoked cigarettes and offered advice freely;
their day’s work was done, and to watch others still
hard at it was perfect luxury. When we emerged
panting from the top they threw away their cigarette
ends and strolled down to Wastdale for tea. It
required much moral strength to refrain from joining
them, but there was the Great Central still on hand,
and that other little chimney to prospect. If it were
as difficult as report said, then we were bound to stay
and climb it. So we worked round to the end of
the wire fence and looked for our gully. Its name
perhaps suggests a great gap in the mountain side,
visible for miles round, and as unavoidable by the
wanderer on this side of Gable as the Edgware Road
is said to be by the Frenchman in London. But if
this be so the name is misleading. Many people fail
to find the gully in bad weather. Its entrance from
below is narrow and its exit above is ill defined. A
short distance to the east of the Doctor’s Chimney
the scree-walk up the crag, that leads past the relics
of the smuggler’s inclosure, insures a safe passage to
the top of the cliff. This scree gully faces Kirkfell,
and but for the usually poor light on this north face
of the mountain it might be easily recognized from
that side. Scarcely a hundred yards away from the
end of the fence the narrow opening of the Central
Gully may be found; from Beckhead it appears in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
profile, and is not-always manifest. Walking eastwards
along the scree beneath the crags, it is the
first really obvious passage into the heart of the
mountain after leaving the Doctor’s Chimney; the
easy scree walk is not much impressed in the face,
and in a mist it has often been entirely overlooked.
Even in cloudy weather the first pitch of our gully
can be discerned a few feet above us, and identified
by the buttress that partially divides it, the chock-stone
in its right branch, and the fine-looking
‘jammed-stone pinnacle’ that shows up a little
higher on the left.</p>

<p>The first clear account of the gully appeared in
the Wastdale book: ‘In the great gully are found
two pitches near the bottom. The top part may be
varied by crossing a grass slope and joining the easy
scree route, or the climb may be continued by going
straight forward. This looks very hard, but on close
inspection the difficulty entirely disappears; for the
climber is able to pass behind a square tower of rock,
and in this way to enter on the final bit of grass and
rock that brings him out at the top.’</p>

<p>We were a party of three, and managed comfortably
with eighty feet of rope. The first pitch was
easy, what with dry rocks and warm weather. Our
guide started up the buttress that divides the gully,
and at a convenient opportunity stepped back on to
the loose stones in the bed. A few feet brought us
to the second pitch, a trifle harder than the first.
Again the leader worked up a buttress on the left of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
the gully, but this time well in the hollow. Near the
top of the obstruction the left leg had to take the
place of the right, a good handhold above serving to
insure the safe transfer, and then a ledge could be
reached by the right foot. The body was next
swung over to that side, and so to the crest of the
pitch.</p>

<p>Here the gully looked very attractive. On the
left rose the jammed-stone pinnacle, an easy chimney
leading up to the cleft that separates it from the
mountain. Two big boulders bridge the cleft near
the crest of the little passage, the higher one offering
a safe way to the summit of the pinnacle. It is from
here that the progress or ‘rake’ can be made out
across to the foot of the Oblique Chimney and on
towards Stony Gully at the east end of Gable Crag.</p>

<p>Just above us a third pitch barred the way. The
gully was much wider here, and greater diversity of
method was now possible. The guide counselled
the direct attack of the short crack in front. The
philosopher prudently suggested that time was an
object and the crack a hard nut; we ought to take the
easy corner on the left. The friend that completed
our trio gave the casting vote in favour of overtime
and ten hours’ work per day during holidays. The
crack was certainly awkward. It was at first easiest
to face towards the right and work up nine or ten
feet. Then when the foothold was of the fanciest of
orders it became desirable to effect a half-turn of the
body so that the other side of the crack might be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
faced. Once the turn was accomplished, a fine
hand-hold made the rest easy; we could pull up the
corner and walk out at the top, some twenty-five
feet above the foot of the pitch. Our friend was
thinking evidently of his casting vote when he
followed the guide; for at the turning-point a slip
cast him on to the rope and gave him an extra turn
that he scarcely appreciated. But the leader was
safely ensconced above, and the poor fellow hastened
up to assure himself that the rope really had been
held tightly. The philosopher eschewed the cause
of this momentary retrogression, and came quietly
up the grass and rock corner well to the left of the
gully.</p>

<p>We were now almost out on the face of the
mountain. Very little remained of the gully as such.
The ordinary walk away towards the right was
perfectly plain. Mr. Robinson’s route upwards,
described in the extract just quoted, was a little to
the left, but not at all easy to locate, for the square
tower of rock blocked the direct view of the climb.
Straight up above us we saw a wall of about a hundred
feet of apparently sheer rock, down the centre
of which passed the crack or chimney that we were
to take for our finish.</p>

<p>Loose earthy steps led to the foot of the wall,
and for a moment we thought with some apprehension
that the first part was going to be seriously
troublesome. At a height of twenty-five feet or so
some narrow splintered boulders completely filled up
the crack and overhung considerably. Just below
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
them the climbing was obviously awkward, by reason
of the footholds that were not there, if the ancient
Hibernianism may be tolerated, and the necessary
leverage on the boulders when we were using them
for all they were worth would imperil their stability
and our own. But after mounting the first twelve
feet with, perhaps, more case than we had anticipated,
a narrow ledge showed up on the right wall for about
ten feet, and we noticed with relief that at its further
extremity another traverse led back to the crack in
a slanting direction to a point just above the critical
spot. This diversion we promptly accepted, and
found it altogether satisfactory. The lower ledge
was just wide enough for the feet, and handholds
just good enough for the balance of the body during
the transfer. At the further end it was easy scrambling
to the upper ledge, which showed itself as a
broad and safe path to a little niche where the crack
was somewhat enlarged. The floor of the niche
was formed of loose stones supported on the larger
jammed blocks that had affrighted us below, and
was sufficiently commodious for all the party to place
themselves securely thereon. Probably the next
part of the climb was the hardest. That, at any
rate, was the opinion of those who had recommended
the route to us, and after their kindly advice we
were gratefully prepared to accept anything from
them in the way of opinion. The chimney was
vertical and its two walls almost holdless.</p>

<p>Direct progress seemed barred by three thick
plates of rock wedged into the crack and projecting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
outwards some three or four feet. Over these we
had to make our way, and if their edges proved to be
unsatisfactory for the fingers to grip or the arms to
clasp, then we should have to return with the ignominy
of defeat. On the one hand appearances were against
us; the pitch looked impossible. But on the other
we knew it had been climbed once or twice before,
and assuredly under no better conditions than were
vouchsafed to ourselves. Far away down at the foot
of the gully we noticed a couple of men who had
been walking Wastdale-wards after a hard day, but
were gazing up at us in some curiosity to know how
we were going to tackle our problem. It would
never do to go back now.</p>

<p>And thus, after sacrificing such time and small
reflections to the reputed difficulty of the place as its
admirers would have claimed of us, we turned our
gaze upwards and climbed the pitch. It went off
pleasantly enough. An easy clamber led to a second
platform immediately below the jammed plates.
A foot or two higher, and a ledge on the left
could be used for the one hand, the edge of the lowest
overhanging block with the other, while the left leg
was swung up on to a shelf. The attitude was
awkward just for the moment, but with both arms
clasping the plate of rock, which was perfectly trustworthy,
there could be no thought of falling for the
leader, who had only to thrust himself forward
into an upper recess and wriggle into safety.</p>

<p>Here he discovered another level platform, neatly
turfed and obviously constructed as a climber’s resting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
place. It would have been easy to stay there and
negotiate the rope for the other men below, but the
next pitch was only ten feet higher up, and led to a
still better corner. Therefore he went on by straightforward
hand-and-foot work, and climbed the pitch
by its left-hand branch. The chimney is here about
eight feet wide, divided into two by a long and
narrow boulder.</p>

<p>The right-hand branch is just possible, but the
sense of insecurity at one spot almost demands help
from below. On the left a deep recess is floored
with splintered blocks that threaten to break away
but cannot easily manage it. The boulder offered
enough assistance in the way of holds, especially a
sharp edge at the top, and when overcome showed
itself to be the last genuine obstacle in our course.
We were soon all gathered together at the little
notch that marks the top of the chimney, and after
adding a stone to the cairn that stands there, we
marched up some thirty feet of solid buttress and
broke at a plunge through the thick cornice of old
snow that yet remained as a token of the hard winter
that had come and gone.</p>

<p>The easy finish to the right of the last vertical
wall passes up scree from the top of the third pitch,
and takes us on to a ridge of rock above the
Smuggler’s Retreat. Here it joins the Scree Gully,
and we have a small piece of hand-and-foot work
before it narrows, then curves away to the left, and
finally ends on a ledge of broken rock close to the
highest point.

<span class="large"><i>THE GREAT NAPES AND ITS GULLIES</i></span></h2>

<p>It has already been explained that the Great
Napes rises like a huge screen out of the southern
slopes of Gable. Its crest runs from north-west to
south-east. It is possible to travel along the whole
length of the ridge from Hell’s Gate (called Deep
Gill on the Ordnance map) to the White Napes
scree at Little Hell Gate, and this route, religiously
followed without divergence on to either face, will
be found to offer many interesting pitches. The outside
face of the Napes is cut by the Needle Gully,
the Eagle’s Nest Gully, and the Arrowhead Gully,
taken in order from east to west.</p>

<p>The Needle Gully has two separate branches
leading to the crest of the Napes, neither of them
particularly difficult or interesting. The Eagle’s
Nest Gully is in summer time little more than a
scree walk. So likewise is the main Arrowhead
Gully, which, however, has a branch up to the left
leading to a fine-looking chimney and out on to the
open face two-thirds of the way up towards the
ridge. To the west of the Arrowhead Gully the
Napes is much less imposing, and though small
gullies cut it up considerably they are too indefinite
to particularize.

<p class="small">(<i>Face page 146</i>)</p></div>

<p>The chief <i>arêtes</i> on the face are, taking them in
order from east to west, the Needle ridge immediately
to the right of the Needle Gully; the
Eagle’s Nest ridge between the Eagle’s Nest Gully
and the Needle Gully; and the Arrowhead ridge
between the Eagle’s Nest Gully and the Arrowhead
Gully. All these <i>arêtes</i> offer most enjoyable climbs.
The Gable Needle (or Napes Needle) is a sharp
pinnacle rising vertically from the lower part of the
Needle ridge. It is a climb for experts only, with
steady heads. The Bear rock is a smaller pinnacle
a few yards to the west of the foot of Arrowhead
Gully. Its ascent is a simple problem in rock-climbing&mdash;a
pull up with the arms from the notch
at the back&mdash;but it is worth visiting on account of
its singular aspect.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Arrowhead Gully</span> is almost entirely
devoid of interest. It has not often been visited, for
the reason that its material is loose, its one pitch is
easy, and the neighbourhood is very rich in more
inviting climbs. A large party went up it last
April and were exceedingly unhappy so long as a
single member remained in it. Our interest had
been concentrated on the Eagle’s Nest ridge, and
after some considerable time had been spent about
the crags, we found ourselves at the foot of the
Arrowhead Gully, afflicted with the unanimous desire
to reach the summit of the Napes by a way that none
of us had attempted before. There remained to us
this gully and its branch up by the left. It soon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
became manifest that we should have to divide, for
the place was too small to hold us, and too narrow
to permit free passage of loose stones that the higher
members almost immediately began to dislodge. We
lunched a few feet up the left branch, and were
decidedly uncomfortable during our hasty meal.
The ledges that we had chosen were so uncertain
and the scree below so steep that all were glad when
the sandwiches were finished and preparations commenced
for roping-up. My own section of the party
elected to follow the branch to its abrupt ending
out on the face. The others kept to the main gully,
and were busy chimney-sweeping most of their time.
Their one pitch was straightforward, but loose blocks
abounded and required careful treatment so long as
their fall might endanger the safety of any one.
Over would go a boulder as soon as the last man had
passed it, smashing from side to side, and we in our
gully vaguely wondered, at each successive bombardment
of the Arrowhead, whether it would not be fair
to give the next comers the credit of trying a new
climb; the old gully was rapidly altering, and the
change in its ancient landmarks testifying to the
influence of man as a geological agent. But in spite
of their extensive quarrying operations they reached
their destination before us. We found that our
variation involved some good climbing, spoilt, however,
by a plentiful supply of dangerous <i>débris</i> on all
its available ledges. I was leading, and therefore
safe from bombardment; but those below me were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
now and again peppered, and my feelings hurt by
their objurgations. Those who read this book as a
literary production will, no doubt, sympathise with
the writer in his difficulties with so limited a vocabulary
as climbing affords. That words of primary
importance are few is a fact patent to all students of
the “Alpine Journal.” But in moments of excitement
the climber is urged to expand his limits, and
to call on other sciences (notably the theological) for
suitable expressions that will relieve his feelings.</p>

<p>We started by working up on the right to a ledge
at the foot of the big pitch. Then followed a traverse
across to a short chimney on the other side. This
chimney was obviously a possible route, but for
greater safety and in order to avoid a lengthening of
the rope between the second man and myself, I worked
up for a few feet and then rounded the buttress into
the central portion of the gully, where a second
crack started upwards. Six feet higher this crack
terminated at the same level as the left-hand chimney,
and some dangerously loose grass holds helped me
to drag up into a small cave where moderate anchorage
could be obtained. Unfortunately a block as
large as my fist managed to escape past me and to
attack deliberately the unlucky member of our party.
He, poor man! has the reputation of never being
missed by a vagrant stone, and on this occasion he was
hit rather badly on the head. It was no use hurrying,
but we feared a faint, and when two of us were
squeezed well into the cave, the wounded man was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
engineered up to our level. He was a bit dazed, but
on the whole seemed moderately jubilant at this
latest proof of his case-hardened condition. When
reassured as to his welfare we wriggled clumsily out
of the narrow cave, feet foremost, and made our way
easily by the left wall to the roof of the cave and the
top of the pitch. The rest of the gully was little
more than mere walking, and a few minutes later we
joined our friends on the crest of the Napes.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Needle Gully</span> has rather a bad reputation.
My personal experience of it has not been altogether
pleasant. I tried it in January, 1893, with the enterprising
classic referred to in my account of the
Oblique Chimney, and found the soft snow so
troublesome in its steepness and want of tenacity
that we decided to leave the gully for some more
auspicious occasion. The opportunity came in the
following August, after an ascent of the Needle, and
with it came the conviction that in dry weather the
gully possesses no interest to the climber pure and
simple, if such an anomaly exists, but that it should
be visited by those who take pleasure in rock scenery.
The Eagle’s Nest ridge is a marvellously fine sweep
of clean-cut rock bounding the western wall of the
gully. The jagged outline of the Needle ridge on
the eastern side is scarcely inferior in grandeur.</p>

<p>We found two easy pitches to begin with, taking
us to about the level of the Needle summit. Then
a vertical wall interposed itself directly in our way.
We scrambled in or near a slight cleft on our right,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
using rather treacherous grass-covered ledges, and
distributing our weight over as many points of support
as possible. That portion of the pitch was only
about three feet high, and then came a momentary
‘easy’ before another steep little bit of eight feet.
The resting place is just large enough for one man.
At the top of the second piece a ledge led round by
the left past an awkward corner that seemed to
alarm our more substantial members by its narrowness,
and then two or three steep grass steps had to
be taken directly upwards. There we found a projecting
knob forming a convenient saddle for each to
anchor as he manipulated the rope for the man below,
a deep crack offering itself in the right position for
belaying the rope. A foot or two higher, and we
were able to traverse back into the bed of the gully,
and thence find an easy way up screes and short rock
slopes to the top. The climb along the ridge itself
to the highest point of the Napes was pleasantly
varied. We could readily distinguish the points of
articulation of the chief buttresses, for the general
angle was too steep to disguise the contours. When
close to the connecting ridge between Napes and the
Westmorland crags we bore down on to Hell’s Gate
screes and crossed over to the opposite rocks to hunt
out the little climb up to the Westmorland cairn.
This was not so easy to find, and we wasted much
time in attempting an attack by some smooth slabs too
high up the scree. At last we found that the climb
began in a small gully some distance down, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
bore upwards a little to the right till a short pinnacle
was reached. Then from the neck behind the
pinnacle we traversed across the face to the left for
a few yards, before climbing hand over hand to the
summit ridge. It came as a surprise that the ascent
had such neatness; and we were all at the end
willing enough to indorse the favourable opinions
expressed in the climbing book. Be it remembered
that the cairn at the top was built by the brothers
Westmorland of Penrith, not for the purpose of
indicating the finish of a climb, but to mark the
coign of vantage for one of the finest mountain views
in the country. Remember also that proposition of
a well-known mountaineer that the view from a
summit is much the same whatever be the route
taken to get there; and apply it by visiting Westmorland
cairn to look at the Napes, even if the
expedition involves no troublesome climbing.

<span class="large"><i>THE RIDGES OF THE GREAT NAPES</i></span></h2>

<p><span class="large2">The Needle Ridge</span> is usually taken from the
foot of the Needle itself. It was explored first in
1884 by Mr. Haskett Smith, who then made a
general survey without actually completing the
climb. Two years later he effected a descent of the
whole route; and in 1887 Mr. Slingsby’s party
made the first strict ascent, and were emphatic in
their praise of its fine character.</p>

<p>The introductory few feet from the notch behind
the Needle are difficult, the problem being to climb
up a steep slab of six feet or so to the foot of a slight
grass chimney that slopes upwards to the right.
Three fingers of the right hand can be inserted in a
curious pocket in the slab; rather poor foothold is all
that can be found for steadying purposes, and for the
rest just enough will manifest itself to enable the
climber to cautiously drag himself up to a small
ledge, and thence to the foot of the chimney.</p>

<p>This takes him easily to about the level of the
top of the Needle. There a poised block is passed
on the left, that used to give trouble. I once saw
my leader attempt to climb directly over it. When
in the very act of pulling himself on to its upper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
surface it slowly swung round, as if pivoted at each
extremity. Fortunately he was not tempted to let
go, and it readjusted itself in a firmer position without
quitting its niche. My friend led no more that
day, and we afterwards solemnly warned folks
against the boulder variation. The stone is yet
there and is still insecure, but climbers pass round
by the right and then work back on to the edge of
the <i>arête</i> and up to the foot of the vertical wall that
begins the second part of the climb. It is not
unusual for the first part to take so long a time in
severe weather as to convince a prudent party that
it is expedient to utilize a grass traverse into the
Needle Gully that here discloses itself on the left.
This ledge takes them safely to a point in the bed of
the gully above the chief pitch, and within a few
minutes’ easy scrambling of the top.</p>

<p>The first part of the Needle Ridge may be neatly
varied by climbing the buttress up from the gully, or
by working across to the same buttress from the
Needle notch. These variations are a little harder
than the usual climb, but both are safe in dry
weather.</p>

<p>As illustrating the way not to use a rope, an
amusing story is told of the first difficulty on the
Needle ridge. Two young fellows had walked up to
the foot of the gully with another party of climbers,
and had lazily discussed their lunch and their plans
for the day while the others were busy on the
Needle. After deciding that they knew the Needle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
too well to learn anything by climbing it, they went
on to examine critically, from a distance, the Eagle’s
Nest opposite and to point out the way that they
would insure their own safety in an attack on it.
They scoffed at its reputed severity, and would
really have then and there shown the neatest method
of vanquishing it. On the other hand, it was a
warm day, and they felt a little slack. Perhaps the
Needle Ridge would tickle their jaded appetites a
bit. Yes! they would walk up the ridge and get
some fresh air 400 feet higher. Then they tossed
up for leadership, and tied on their forty feet rope&mdash;one
man at each end. Away went the leader from
the notch, over the slab and up the chimney. When
at the end of his rope it occurred to him to look
back and see what his companion was doing. The
poor fellow had stuck at the slab, and was in imminent
danger of falling backwards. ‘Good gracious,
man, what are you thinking of?’ shouted the
indignant leader. ‘I am not going to be pulled
down for any one!’ and promptly began to unrope
himself. Then the man who tells the story hurried
up from below, and fortunately arrived in time to
prevent a catastrophe. Such an aspect of the utility
of the rope need scarcely be commented upon, but I
was not surprised a day or two after hearing the
story to be characterized by a non-climbing acquaintance
in town as a desperate venturesome individual,
one who went about climbing mountains <i>with a rope</i>.
By non-climbers a rope must indeed be regarded as
a source of danger.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>The plainest view of the upper platform of the
Needle and the awkward corner that rises from it is
to be had at the expense of a few minutes’ digression
from the ridge. It is best to climb from the top
of the grass chimney over to the right, and then
down a steep and loose recess to a grass platform.
A photograph of the Needle from this point of view
has been published, and is an interesting one to
study.</p>

<p>The second part of the Needle Ridge begins with
a vertical wall of rock that from below appears very
formidable. With ice about it is certainly difficult,
and the traverse to the gully on the left is the wisest
course to pursue under such conditions. But on
close inspection a square corner discloses itself in the
wall, and the fifteen feet of scrambling in the cleft are
perfectly straightforward. At the top of the wall
the ridge is broken up in a wonderful way, and huge
blocks are distributed along the route in great profusion.
The climbing becomes very easy, though
retaining its interest to the finish at the top of the
Napes; and the whole ascent may be disposed of
summarily in half an hour from the Needle notch.</p>

<p class="small">(<i>Face page 156</i>)</p></div>

<p><span class="large2">The Eagle’s Nest Ridge</span> was climbed on
April 15, 1892, by a strong party of cragsmen.
They were led by Mr. G. A. Solly, who was well
backed up by Mr. Cecil Slingsby. They left a
record of the expedition in the Wastdale book, and
let the climbing fraternity decide for themselves as to
whether the ascent was worth repeating. No exception
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
can be taken to the rocks, which are perfectly
sound and reliable, but an inspection of the ridge
from the Needle shows how little hold there is
for hands or feet. Moreover, the hardest part is so
situated that a safe descent from it is well-nigh impossible
for the unlucky leader who finds his strength
or skill inadequate to cope with it. Nevertheless,
I have recently discovered that with an exact
knowledge of the available holds, and with the best
conditions of the rocks, a man may safely tackle the
ascent if well supported by a sturdy second. The
situation is terribly exposed for the first 140 feet,
and will try the nerves of even experienced mountaineers.
Dependence is often placed on small footholds
that slope slightly to the climber’s disadvantage;
and on such ledges good nailed boots and
perfect confidence are essential. The fact is that
the ridge is not to be recommended; and its virtue
is that there is no deception about it. The clean
sweep of the sharp nose of rock from the green
platform at the foot up to the patch of grass where
the slanting chimney begins scares everybody away,
tyros and experts alike. That almost vertical
buttress looks impossible, and to nearly everybody it
is so.</p>

<p>It was a felicitous discovery of Mr. Solly’s, a
day later, that the worst part of the <i>arête</i> could
be avoided by taking to a chimney a few feet away
to the left. Looking up at the ridge from the grass
platform at its foot, the appearance presented is that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
of a vertical face of rock out by two chimneys each
about a hundred feet long. The right of these is
shallow and open, with tufts of grass interspersed
with smooth slabs. Whether it can be climbed or
not I have never ascertained. But the left chimney
or gully is deeply cut into the wall. Its aspect is
ferocious, but its disposition gentle. It can be easily
reached and comfortably climbed. Solly’s original
route was up the strict <i>arête</i> to the right of both
chimneys. The <i>arête</i> to the left of both was investigated
at Easter, 1895, and manifested an inclination
to yield to the attack of a party. But the party has
not yet preferred the attack, and the suggestion may
be taken at its worth. Our gully is rather earthy
for the first forty feet, and care must be taken by the
leader to avoid dislodging stones on those below him.
Then the rockholds change in character just above
an outstanding pinnacle on the left, and there is an
interesting passage into a niche at the back of the
gully, a sloping and well-worn hold for the right foot
offering the safest support as the body is dragged
over into the corner. Hence the route is up the
crack for a few feet and across a long slab to the
right-hand wall, care being taken with a loose
splinter that is generally seized as the handiest grip
available. The rest of the gully is of grass and
small scree, and at the top a view may be obtained
down into the Arrowhead Gully. But for the ridge
climb a divergence is made to the right almost
immediately after the chimney pitch is passed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

<p>A split is noticed in the <i>arête</i>, forming a small and
sharp pinnacle, just below which the shallow, grass-tufted
chimney finishes in sorry fashion. The climber
passes through the cleft, utilizing a large block that
is not quite fixed. On the other side he finds the
junction with the original ridge route, ten feet below
the finish of the curdling part. His next move is
awkward, over a smooth rock with unsatisfactory
sloping footholds, but there is no real danger with
the second man at the cleft, and the leader reaches the
grassy recess where, in the words of the first explorers,
the difficulties moderated. It is large enough for
two men to brace themselves firmly, and manipulate
150 feet of rope for an enterprising third man who
may wish to come up by way of the outside edge.</p>

<p>This route to the recess we shall now briefly
describe, suggesting at the same time that no man
should attempt to lead up it who has not already
explored the ground with the safeguard of a rope
from above. From the horizontal grass platform at
the foot of the climb a narrow cleft runs up to the
ridge in such a way as to separate off the first fifteen
feet from the main mass. The cleft is mounted with
facility by aid of numerous holds of first-rate quality.
At the top we find ourselves on the strict ridge, but
after mounting ten feet the holds disappear entirely,
and the verticalness of the next seven or eight feet
makes a slight divergence absolutely necessary. On the
face of the ridge that bounds the Needle Gully below
us two parallel cracks run up steeply about a yard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
apart. They are so closed, and they run so obliquely
up the wall, that good foothold is impossible in
either, and handhold of even moderate quality
requires much seeking. Nevertheless, they are both
of immense importance, and are capable of giving all
the required aid. The leader should here be joined
by the second, and should belay himself to the
highest effective part of the broken rock below him.
His companion should be belayed independently.
Then his next move is to work up for three feet on
to the right-hand crack, with his fingers gripping the
other, until the latter is felt to be good enough for a
pull towards the ridge. The transfer of the right
foot into the crack on the left is critical. I prefer to
effect the passage without boots, as the toes can feel
so much better where the crack is deepest. Then
the outside edge a yard away to the left is within
reach of the hand, and the leader, cut off from
further assistance below, must manage very carefully
to climb on to the ridge.</p>

<p>His holds are obvious; the difficulty is not so
much in finding the way as in keeping to it. Fortunately
a little flat platform is now reached, on
which he can sit in comfort and recover his strength
before attacking the next part. It is at about the
level of the top of the Gable Needle, and Mr.
Slingsby tells me it is the spot that the first
climbers named the Eagle’s Nest. It is just visible
against the sky in the view facing page 153, 3&frac12;
inches from the foot of the illustration. The awkward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
part first ascended is scarcely twelve feet high, but
is exceptionally severe if the leader takes it without
the assistance of a second.</p>

<p>The consequences of a slip in the next portion of
the climb are more serious, but probably it is technically
less difficult than the lower bit. The Eagle’s
Nest is barely large enough for the leader to brace
himself firmly when helping the second man up on
the rope, and he may naturally prefer to mount
higher without assistance rather than peril the
safety of both for the sake of a helping shoulder up
the next piece. There are no belaying pins, and
traversing to either side of the buttress is seemingly
impossible. If he cannot be certain of holding on to
the rope when a slip occurs to his follower, he had
better decide to advance another fifty feet before the
second man moves from his secure position below.
The first ten feet above the Nest are remarkable for
steepness and smallness of holds. If the rocks are
cold and the finger tips benumbed, the holds cannot
be appreciated at all, and the place becomes horribly
dangerous. Yet there is a sufficiency of grip for
hands and feet, and bootmarks can now be detected
on the chief ledges. With perfect coolness and the
exercise of his best judgment, the solitary leader will
gradually mount the ridge step by step, and the
tension on his nerves and muscles will be relieved
when the level of the narrow pinnacle to the left is
reached, and he notices the numerous scratches on
the rocks of those who have climbed to the junction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
by the easy route. Mr. H. C. Bowen and I made
the second strict ascent in April, 1898, with 100
feet of rope between us.</p>

<p>At the foot of the slanting chimney it again becomes
possible for the leader to obtain assistance
from his companions, though he is not the sort of
man to require it if he has come up by the difficult
way. The climbing is now delightfully safe and
interesting. The holds are good and the ridge
varied. From the top of the slanting chimney,
which can be ascended without trouble, the true
<i>arête</i> below looks desperately stiff. The remainder
of the climb will be found to consist of alternating
horizontal and vertical passages. It is often possible
to pass down the grassy ledges on the left, but the
ridge is much pleasanter, and in wet weather actually
safer. The views down the vertical walls on the
right into the Needle Gully are magnificent, and the
Needle Ridge is seen at its best.</p>

<p>The first party took two hours and ten minutes
to accomplish their ascent. The ridge with the
initial variation by the chimney has been climbed in
half an hour by a party of three; hunger lent wings,
for their lunch was waiting them on Gable.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Arrowhead Ridge</span> derives its name from
a very prominent crag a short distance to the west
of the Eagle’s Nest Ridge. It offers a very fine specimen
of rock architecture, though the artist photographer
has been known to express dissatisfaction at
its outline, and to claim artistic license in modifying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
his pictures to suit his theories. Many of those who
have been attracted to the Great Napes in search
of the original have been much perplexed at the
discrepancy between the old photographs and the
modern reality. Some in their wrath have desired
to get the photographer and his camera below them
in a rickety gully, where, as Dent puts it, no stone
is left unturned in their struggle to reach the top.</p>

<p>But if the artist cuts away a few thousand tons
of rock from his negative with one fell stroke of his
brush, if he commands the sun to stand still and the
shadows to move on, if he subjects his angles to the
influence of the personal equation of the climber
instead of the mere observer, these weaknesses are
not to be recorded against him. Mountaineering as a
sport owes its advancement far more to the inaccurate
descriptions of its literary devotees than to the
simple statements of facts of the scientific, and its
best pictorial advertisements have been those where
art has assisted nature and laughed at science.</p>

<p>This to some extent is what we all need, and
what we all understand. From the top of the Kern
Knotts’ crack the evidence of a freely hanging rope
as to the direction of the vertical actually contradicts
one’s best judgment. The Kern Knotts wall is perhaps
15° from the vertical, but looking down it one
would judge it perpendicular. Yet we never fancy
a foothold horizontal when it is at a slope of 15° to
our disadvantage, else the Eagle’s Nest Ridge would
lose much of its terror. Rather are we then inclined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
to magnify the angle, and the actual slope plus our
own inclination make together something like the
30° that would figure in a fancy sketch or a popular
article.</p>

<p>Education is a marvellously fine thing, and in
mountaineering it works wonders. It enables men
to interpret the barren truth in accordance with
their own experience. Notes of new ascents in the
‘Alpine Journal’ they can enjoy and assimilate; but,
as in eating caviare, the taste needs cultivation, and
many remain unequal to such food to the ends of their
lives. Now because there are many false translations
possible of the one true original, it must be
easy with a knowledge of the truth to interpret it
variously, and correspondingly difficult to get at the
correct version from a bad translation. Even the
mountaineering education fails to help us. All it
does is to give us the taste for truth, and the sense
of right to demand the genuine article. It might be
printed in italics at the beginning of the chapter,
like the usually inappropriate and obscure poetical
references, and so isolated from the author’s personal
exposition. This text and sermon notion has not,
so far as my little library of Alpine books can tell
me, been adopted by any popular writer on mountaineering,
though the difficulty has been grappled
with in other ways. Thus the Alpine historian or
geographer may find the required facts neatly
gathered together in a brief appendix, or still more
briefly summarised in a letter published simultaneously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
with a review of the book in the ‘Alpine
Journal.’</p>

<p>The sale of caviare is strictly limited, and the
demand for ‘Alpine Notes and New Ascents’ confined
to the few. Hence mountaineering books
intended to sell well are written for the uneducated
many, not for teaching purposes, but for the satisfaction
of their desire for tales of adventure. So
long as climbers tolerate this professionalism introduced
into mountaineering&mdash;and there is every
reason why they should in all cases where the
professional is recognized as such&mdash;they must necessarily
give the artist a free hand, whether he writes
or paints or takes photographs. Personally I should
ask for information as to the treatment of any negative
that has been employed for reproduction of
pictures. ‘From a photograph by,’ nowadays
suggests a bad camera, a shaky tripod, an amateur
operator, a cunning artist, and a long purse. But
‘truth is mighty and will prevail,’ so we may as
well get on to the Arrowhead.</p>

<p>Viewing this Arrowhead from the easy ground
near the Bear rock, it is seen to bear some resemblance
to the Gable Needle (see Chapter XI.). In
each case the rock forms the lower extremity of a
Napes ridge, and its sides are remarkable for their
steepness and smoothness. The outside edge of
each is broken by a well-marked shoulder, and the
head of the Arrow may be fairly well likened to the
top overhanging boulder on the Needle. Here,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
perhaps, the resemblance ends. Certain parts of the
climbing on the Arrowhead must be characterized as
insecure, whereas the Needle is firm throughout.
The former may easily be attacked from the notch
behind it, the Needle cannot be similarly treated.
The original climb up to the shoulder on the Arrowhead
was by a recess on the east side, that up the
Needle by a narrow crack on the west. (See photograph
facing page 153.)</p>

<p>The first ascent dates from April, 1892, when a
large party attacked the rock on the lines just
indicated. The lower part of the buttress was
mounted by a steep and open recess on the western
side, a good climb leading directly to the shoulder
half-way up, where the route was joined by the
upper end of a corresponding chimney on the other
side of the buttress. Thence the climbing was
straight up the corner. It was not very difficult,
but at a point a few feet below the final bit the
rocks were insecure and the situation alarming.
The stones are better now than formerly, but great
caution must be used. In 1893 another party repeated
the ascent, and showed that it was possible
by passing round to the gap at the back to continue
the climb along the ridge. The usual route nowadays
is to reach the ridge by the scree gully between
the Arrowhead and the Eagle’s Nest <i>arête</i>, climbing
up the side wall to the notch, and so avoiding the
Arrowhead itself. The wall is steep, but its ledges
are conveniently disposed, and no trouble should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
experienced in the ascent. Once on the ridge the
climbing is delightful. The holds are good, and the
narrowness of the crest along which we pass gives
the spice of sensationalism that at all times offers an
apology for easy climbing. The actual ascent of
the ridge need take but twenty minutes, the descent
about half an hour for a party of three, when conditions
are favourable. There is one <i>mauvais pas</i> of
moderate quality: a wall of ten feet must be mounted
to reach the crest of a tower on the ridge. Then
follows a long stride across the gap on the other
side, and it is sometimes amusing to watch the timid
climber who fears that he may not be able to swing
the hind leg over when in the colossus attitude half-way
across. Above this all difficulties soon disappear;
the gullies on either side rapidly rise to our
own level, and the ridge ends shortly before the
crest of the Napes is reached.</p>

<span class="large"><i>THE GABLE NEEDLE</i></span></h2>

<p>The best-known rock problem in the district
is offered by the Gable Needle. Its position has
already been defined. As we walk towards Styhead
from Esk Hause the Needle stands out from the west
face of the Gable very plainly; but from Wastdale
it is almost invisible against the background of the
indistinguishable Napes rocks, and only those who
know exactly where it should be are bold enough to
say where it is. Very few people seem to have seen
it before 1886, when Mr. Haskett Smith reached the
top, though Mr. Wilson Robinson made a pencil
outline-sketch of both the Needle and the Bear rock
as long ago as 1828. Many even who were
acquainted with the crags of the Napes had not
noticed it. The fact is that a face of rock is very
apt to look flat and void of detail at a short
distance; and it is the joy of the rock-climber to
discover its thousand beauties when he engages with
it at close quarters.</p>

<p>(<i>Face page 168</i>)</p></div>

<p>The Needle is indeed a fine fellow as rocks go&mdash;just
the sort of ornament for one’s back garden in
town, a gymnasium in itself. It has now many
admirers. The few footholds on the top boulder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
bear the marks of many nailed boots, even its
smooth face is scored by futile scrapes of the
nervous, but it retains its charm for the Wastdale
enthusiast. In his dreams he takes a hammer and
chisel, and chips away an important hold, and with
the dreamer’s ease swarms up the rock unaided.
Again a hold is chipped away confidently with the
faith that removes mountains, and again he glides
up and down; till at last its small top draws him up
without effort and he hastens down to Wastdale to
invite the attention of climbers to the new edition
of the Needle.</p>

<p>Mr. Haskett Smith climbed it alone in 1886 and
left a handkerchief on the top. Those who have
been once on the Needle will readily believe that
this first ascent is one of the most daring things
that have been done in the Lake District.</p>

<p>He pointed it out to Mr. John Robinson one day
when they were traversing the face of the Napes
on to the Needle <i>arête</i>, and they both agreed
that it had a future before it, that their successors
in the field of climbing would make it their resort
and perhaps even build a diminutive shrine on its
crest to the discoverer. Nearly three years elapsed
before Mr. Geoffrey Hastings made the second
ascent. Then, in June, 1889, Mr. F. Wellford
climbed it, and Mr. Robinson made the fourth
ascent in August. In the following year Professor
Marshall’s party attacked the climb, spending three-quarters
of an hour in flinging a rope over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
summit for the benefit of the leader. On that
occasion Miss Koecher reached the top&mdash;the first
lady, at any rate in modern times, to succeed in
doing so.</p>

<p>Dr. S. and I travelled down to Drigg one night.
We breakfasted there early and walked the twelve
miles to Wastdale, halting only for a plunge into
cold Wastwater. After the manner of our kind, we
inquired at once for the Climbing Book, to learn the
latest news from the Fells. The ‘Pall Mall Budget’
article of June 5, 1890, on the Needle, had been
inserted, and we read how it might be vanquished.
In the afternoon we worked our way up to the
Napes. Being the more enthusiastic, I found the
Needle first, and was breathless on the top of the
crack when Dr. S. arrived. He threw a rope up
from the small platform (seen at the bottom of the
picture facing page 168) and came after me. The
crack up the face seemed difficult that first time;
most people find it so. The first movement obliquely
up to the left is easy, but the next part is a trifle
too safe for the new comer. He gets his left thigh
almost hopelessly jammed into the crack, and can
move neither up nor down. The best plan is to
work more with the left foot and knee in the crack,
both hands on the edge of the leaf of rock, and the
right leg getting general support by pressure outside,
until the most constricted bit half-way up is passed.
Then the leaf of rock can be swarmed up with much
greater ease, and the climber soon finds himself
looking down the other side of the crack.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<p>From here the route for ten feet is directly up the
right edge. The holds are not numerous, but good
enough when the rocks are dry, and we find ourselves
on a platform or shoulder, very conspicuous in most
aspects of the pinnacle, that serves as an excellent
take-off for the last struggle. The terrors of the
crack often scare off people from the final piece. They
almost did our little party. I found my watch-chain
broken&mdash;some links still remain in the heart of the
Needle&mdash;and my watch badly dented. The ‘Pall
Mall’ had promised us that the last bit was the
worst, and we thought for a moment that a little
preliminary training for a few days would be the
correct thing. However, I took off my boots, for
they had no nails, and, standing on a shoulder of
Dr. S;, stepped on to the right end of the ledge on
which the top block rests. This corner is difficult
to climb alone and exceedingly daring work, for the
climber drags his body on to it over a sheer drop of
a hundred feet, and feels no certainty of safety till
he is up. It is like climbing on a narrow mantelshelf
five feet high, that is only just wide enough to
allow standing room. An ice-axe offers a useful
take-off in the absence of a sufficiently responsible
shoulder. The disposition of one’s centre of gravity
must be carefully considered, and there is a sense of
alternate peril and safety in inspiration and expiration.
Once on the ledge the game was evidently in
our hands, and traversing along it to the left I found
a rounded boss of rock eighteen inches higher that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
offered good hold for both feet. Then the left was
brought well up to a little ledge nearly an inch
wide, the right hand gripped the right edge of the
boulder, and on straightening out the top edge could
be grasped. An arm pull was helped by sundry
roughnesses for the toes, and I sprawled half across
the top triumphantly. In a couple of minutes Dr. S.
was by my side. We had no intention of climbing
higher that day, and willingly spent half an hour in
examining the routes of the Napes’ ridges, two of
which are seen to advantage from this spot.</p>

<p>We descended without serious difficulty, Dr. S.
going first. I half decided to fix our rope round
the top block and use it for my own descent, but it
would have been an awkward matter to detach it
afterwards. Moreover, others had not found a fixed
rope necessary, and we did not wish to have anything
to reproach ourselves about subsequently. Dr. S.
placed himself firmly on the shoulder, drawing in
the rope as it came down. If I fell it would have
been on to the rocks a few feet below him; he would
experience no great shock, and could easily hold me
in. The descent was by the exact route of the
ascent. On reaching the crack again we re-adjusted
our boots and slid down easily, the remembrance of
the leg-clasping constriction preventing our jamming
in the descent.</p>

<p>Two or three days later we took other men up
the Needle. It was like introducing an old friend.
Though I had lost no respect for him, he was easier
to manage and offered new features for inspection.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>The side of the Needle facing Lingmell exhibits
an obvious alternative route to the shoulder. The
climbing is twelve or fifteen feet longer, and rather
more interesting. Facing the Needle at its foot with
our backs to Lingmell, we bear to the right into a
square corner. We pass up this on the left to a
little level platform, reached best by an armpull and
a foothold well away on the buttress. I have seen
good men in much trouble on this corner. From here
the route is straight up the wall, with a halting-place
ten feet higher in a huge slit on the right. Then
we climb the same cleft whose other side constitutes
the first part of the old route. This side, however,
is wider, and contains sundry jammed stones for
convenience of passengers. The old route is joined
without difficulty, and the shoulder reached as
before.</p>

<p>To effect the ascent of the top boulder without
help it has always appeared to me easier to start by
standing on the small shelf just under the left-hand
end of the overhanging part&mdash;the shelf, in fact, that
is occupied by the sitting figure in the view facing
page 168. Practice on ordinary strong mantelshelves
enables one to mount up this corner with a certainty
of success, the right hand being thrust into a thin
horizontal cleft rough enough to offer some friction
for the back of the hand as well as the palm.</p>

<p>If people are at the Needle and wish to explore
it, they may like to know that Mr. W. H. Fowler
has shown that the ‘outside edge’ can be followed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
from bottom to top. Also, that it is not so difficult
to work from the foot of the ordinary route round to
the other side of the cleft that splits the Needle.
To photograph the Needle we usually get up the
other side of the Needle Gully at the foot of the
Eagle’s Nest <i>arête</i>. Indeed, this grass ledge is so
popular for the observation of a performance that it
is known as the ‘dress circle.’ One photograph exists
of the Needle in which nearly all the climbing
details are masked by a crowd of daring maidens
swarming up it. Two have reached the top, and are
supporting a terror-stricken man, who, poor fellow,
had rashly undertaken to lead up. The picture
suggests the old problem of the mediæval theologians&mdash;how
many angels can balance on the point
of a needle?

<span class="large"><i>KERN KNOTTS</i></span></h2>

<p><span class="large2">Kern Knotts Chimney.</span>&mdash;This is one of the
prettiest things in the neighbourhood, and it photographs
well. The small bunch of hard rock that
crops out of the wilderness of scree on this side of
the Gable was at one time rarely visited, though so
near the actual Styhead path. Its name was almost
unknown. I confused it with the Tom Blue crags
higher up on the fell. Nowadays the good quality of
the chimney attracts many visitors, and several come
to see it who do not actually climb. The Knotts are in
three parts&mdash;Raven Crag, and Upper and Lower Kern
Knotts. The middle part is the steepest and longest.
A prominent nose or buttress springs down its centre,
and is visible in profile at a great distance. The
buttress is split off from the main mass by a vertical
crack extending from side to side, varying in thickness
from three or four inches to a foot.</p>

<p>The chimney had been inspected by earlier
climbers before I had ever heard of it. The uninitiated
of Wastdale often lament the secretiveness
of those who know where new things exist but who
keep the knowledge to themselves. Nestor is very
reticent, and it is to be counted unto him for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
righteousness that one Christmas week, after bad
weather had deprived us of all the ordinary climbing,
he announced to the engineer and me that there was
a fascinating little thing, the fancy of an ‘off’ afternoon,
lying conveniently close to the hotel, that he
would show us how to climb. I was lying on the
billiard table just then thinking of the different kinds
of nothing. ‘Where is it?’ I asked. ‘In Tom
Blue’ was the reply, and as this was yet but a name
to me I wondered whether Tom’s blueness measured
his difficulty. The engineer was enthusiastic, and
declined to allow me to remain longer on the billiard
table after hearing this news. So in the gentle rain
we marched out of the inn that afternoon, and worked
our way up the Styhead path till we had passed the
little spring that crosses it near the zig-zag. There
we saw the great rocks looming up on the left
and were told that Tom Blue awaited us there. The
steep slope leading up to our climb was strewn with
huge boulders in chaotic confusion. We could
either keep to these or else make for an interesting
crack in the Lower Kern Knotts that stood directly in
our way. To give us a foretaste we took to the
crack, finding as usual that its aspect from a distance
gave no clue to the wealth of useful detail in the
shape of handholds. Then a few yards more of mercurial
skipping from boulder to boulder and we
reached a little terrace at the foot of the fine wall
of the Upper Kern Knotts. Since that day a huge
cairn has grown up on this terrace at an astonishing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
rate of development, to mark the beginning of the
climb. Perhaps by the date of publication of this
volume the cairn will have grown to rival the crags
in height, the climb may be <i>viâ</i> the cairn, and Kern
Knotts Chimney blocked up for ever. But for the
sake of the afternoon strollers from Wastdale we pray
that this may not be. The ascent is apparently in
two portions, the lower one being the easier.
Actually there is a third pitch, the one of perhaps
greatest intrinsic difficulty, starting at the top of the
split buttress and quite unnoticeable from below.
For this reason the climb must be regarded as deceptive;
it is one thing to struggle up the middle pitch
with the impression that the worst piece is being
tackled, and quite another to find a part of exceptional
severity higher up. With that portion impossible
the only alternative is to descend again, and that
does not commend itself to many men who climb
more for amusement than for instruction.</p>

<p>To return to our narrative, we roped up with
hopefulness and took to the lowest chimney. The
rocks were streaming with water which rapidly discovered
that its line of quickest descent was along our
arms and bodies, with only a slight delay at the
boots while they were filling up. The chimney was
sufficiently well provided with small ledges, first in
the middle, then on the right-hand side, to enable us
to draw up easily. Then we worked round to the
foot of the second pitch on a level platform large
enough for us all to rest ourselves comfortably. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
chimney now became much narrower, just sufficiently
large to receive the right thigh. With dry rocks
the slight holds on the left wall now facing us would
have been ample for the pull up to the level of a
jammed stone in the crack; but they were now
doubtful, and the obvious course was to insert the
right hand beneath the jammed stone and utilize the
grip it afforded. A loose block thus handled from
within is much less liable to come out than when
held by its projecting parts. In a climb where every
jammed stone has been tested scores of times, sundry
small precautions such as this may be omitted; but a
new route should always be attacked with respectful
caution, otherwise it may exact a speedy vengeance,
and promptly repulse the careless climber.</p>

<p>Just above the level of this useful block, which
was immediately proved to be safe enough, the
footholds were a short way out of the crack on the
left wall, and were not particularly good in the
heavy rain. The next ten feet appeared to be very
hard, for the only hold was to be by the grip of the
right thigh in the crack, and the next jammed stone
(on which a climber is standing in the opposite illustration)
seemed insecure. It was desirable to pass
this without clinging to its outer edges, and to test
it when its dislodgment could do no harm. The
motion upwards in such a case is rather slow; the leg
that does the work must not be thrust too far into
the recess, or else the business of balancing is awkward,
and the lift at each ‘stroke’ is insufficient.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
The unemployed foot, as the skater calls it, can often
help by a momentary purchase on a minute ledge;
even the width of an eighth of an inch will suffice to
steady the lift.</p>

<p>The jammed stone offered a fair grip underneath,
but the ledges were now on the right wall, and the
turn towards them was difficult under the circumstances.
If we had known that the stone would
hold we could have pulled straight up over it; but,
out of desire to play the scientific game, I swung
round by the hands so that the left leg was in the
crack and the upper handholds visible just above my
head. Next a pull-up enabled me to get the left
knee well on to the stone, and finally to ensconce
myself safely in the recess above it. Then our Nestor
came up in splendid form, but with some anxious
thought for the upper part of the climb. He asked
me to mount up to the bridge above and see whether
the remainder were feasible, for if not the best plan
would be to descend at once. We disagreed over
this, but being grateful for the introduction to ‘Tom
Blue,’ and not knowing that it was Kern Knotts, I
clambered up to please him while he was negotiating
the engineer’s rope, and committed myself to the
opinion that it was ‘all plain sailing from there.’</p>

<p>From the jammed stone which Nestor was now
testing, the route was out over the right face of the
chimney, and round again to the left where the top
figure is shown in the photograph. A big block
forms a bridge, beneath which meet the two chimneys
from the opposite faces of the buttress.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>We all reached the top of the bridge, and
examined the final ridge that springs up for another
hundred feet. The angle is not an easy one at first,
and there is a scarcity of holds. The stylist who
works only with fingers and toes would have much
difficulty in getting up, even in dry weather. We
one by one surmounted it by offering as many points
of contact as possible to the rocks. They were
streaming with water, and in a much more slippery
condition than we should have preferred for a first
ascent. The leader accepted a shoulder at the start,
but he felt rather insecure till he was about twelve
feet up, when a fine hold was found on the right.
From that point the ground is more broken, and
easy scrambling led to the top of the crags.</p>

<p>I have been told since then that it is easier to
work round to the left from the bridge, and then up
to the right; but a recent visit convinces me that
both ways have their difficulties when the rocks are
wet. Both are safe in dry weather. The direct
route up from the bridge has lately been simplified
by an artificial step, evidently cut with a chisel. It
is a pity the timid mason did not go round another
way.</p>

<p>To reach the main shoulder of Gable from here
we may keep on towards Raven Crag and strike up a
short chimney in its centre. It is not difficult, but its
exit from the top takes time if the climber attacks the
problem incautiously. Thence to the summit of Gable
is a glorious walk.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<p>From the ledge at the foot of the Upper Kern
Knotts there rises another buttress a little nearer
the Styhead. Between the two buttresses a short
gully is found which offers a satisfactory route
of descent from the crest of these crags. The
entrance to the gully is difficult if tried from the foot
of the buttress, but easy and suitable for beginners
if taken on the left. It was from this spot that our
party had the first view of the ‘crack’ that was to
offer such sport a year or two later. Nestor with
his characteristic caution vetoed the whole affair,
and vowed he would never speak to me again if I
attempted to climb it. The engineer, on the other
hand, thought that it could not be much worse than
the chimney which we had just climbed in safety,
and that it might be a good thing to keep in mind
for settled weather.</p>

<p>In December, 1895, I went up the chimney with
Mr. and Mrs. F. W. Hill. The rocks were slightly
damp, the weather misty and unpleasant. On the
natural bridge I halted, and looked down the smooth
wall of rock facing the Styhead. The crack was
straight beneath, and Hill nerved me to the sudden
resolve to descend by the rope and prospect the
middle portion of the climb. We had only sixty
feet of rope, but I was let down carefully and
at full distance found myself in a splayed-out
portion above the first pitch. The bit beneath looked
very awkward, so awkward indeed that it seemed
impossible to effect a descent on to the boulders
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
below. There was only one course available, that
of climbing up again. This was not so hard as
I had fancied it would be, for with the sense of the
perfect security in the rope that Hill carefully
manipulated, came freedom of movement and a
bolder style. This is the reason why many Alpine
climbers who know not the joys of leading are
entirely ignorant of their own powers; they as often
err in underestimating as in overrating their skill;
they can gauge their strength only by practice without
rope from above. Emerging from the crack I
joined up on the rope again and finished the rest of
the climb, wondering the while whether a chance
would ever come of penetrating the crack from below.</p>

<p>Before leaving the ordinary chimney, let it be
added that the climb may have an initial variation
by pulling up the vertical rocks to the west of the
foot of the nose; the distance to the first big platform
is increased about fifteen feet, but the way is
pleasanter thus.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Kern Knotts Crack.</span>&mdash;One fine morning in
April I started off for Keswick, grieved to leave Wastdale
and feeling strong after a fortnight’s scrambling.
Surely if the crack could be done at all now would
be the time, with weather and physical fitness corresponding.
Our party was small; two men were
coming with me to look at Kern Knotts, and subsequently
to exploit the Oblique Chimney, the where-abouts
of which had puzzled them the previous day.
It was a bargain between us that they should help
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
me in the crack and I should lead up the Oblique
Chimney afterwards. The advantage was thus all
my own, and their brotherly kindness drew me
to them. It was in the preceding winter that Hill
had let me down from the top of the crack for a
distance of fifty feet to a small loose platform of
rock, and I had with extreme effort managed to
return without tugging the rope. Since that time
there had been opportunity to reflect and decide
that if I could get up to the platform from below
and then help another to the same level, we could
jointly manage the ascent of the crack without
further aid. If the platform could not hold two, it
would be a case of ascending the worst part of the
crack, the splayed-out portion some twelve feet high,
without assistance.</p>

<p>On reaching the spot things looked cheerful
enough. The rocks were dry, and I found that
imagination had somewhat magnified my early impressions
of the wall. But the reality is bad enough.
The wall is one side of a buttress about one hundred
feet in height, and marvellously smooth to look at.
It is out down from top to bottom by a clean-edged
slit passing right through the buttress and forming
on the other side, as I have already explained, the
now familiar Kern Knotts Chimney. At a height
of thirty feet or so from the foot is the little platform,
the niche at the back of which looks as though
carved out for the reception of a piece of statuary.
The portion of the crack that leads up this first part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
has a slightly different outlook; it is more open,
and is provided with holds of a shaky description.
Getting a companion to hold himself in this, I
mounted his shoulder and felt about with the hands.
There was nothing at all that seemed firm. So I
called for the axe, and, remembering certain tactics
in an awful rock climb in Northern Italy some years
before, I rammed the axe longitudinally into the
crack and endeavoured to use it as a hold. The plan
is sometimes effective; it is not sufficiently often
adopted <i>in extremis</i>; but on this occasion it would
not act; the loose stones in the cleft were simply
levered out of place, and I had to pass the axe down
again. Then ensued a few moments’ fatiguing suspension
from one arm with but poor foothold to ease
the strain. It was no go this time; I had to let
myself down and rest awhile. Next we sat on a
boulder opposite the wall, and stared at it silently
for a space. Surely that must be a foothold ten feet
up on the edge of the crack. If, while I mounted his
shoulder, the second man could hold the ice-pick in
a minute fissure in the face, I might manage to step
on to the axe-head and reach the edge of the platform.
It would at any rate prove safer than the
crack route. The plan commended itself to all, and
we placed ourselves in position. It turned out that
the axe was scarcely necessary, for with a little
delicate balancing I reached the top hold with both
hands and dragged up to the lower step in the
ledge. Thence to the platform was an easy matter,
and we all began to breathe freely.

<p class="caption">KERN KNOTTS CRACK</p></div>

<p>It never occurred to me that I had made no
mental note, in my previous ascent of the crack, of the
method of getting up the next part. It was certainly
a stiff struggle that Christmas, but I was then out of
form, and might reasonably hope to succeed more
easily now. Nevertheless, when it came to the test I
found it impossible, three times in succession, to get
my head above a certain projecting block at the top
of the niche. Each time it caught me by the back
of the neck, and would not release me till in desperate
extremity I let myself down again&mdash;no easy
matter with exhausted arms. After the first try my
two friends went round to the other side of the
buttress, and hastily climbed the chimney so as to
be ready to help me. I could hear their every
word through the fissure, and rather surprised them
by making a quiet remark. On a small scale we
were having the Funffingerspitze incident repeated.
Neruda was climbing that famous Dolomite, the scene
of his tragic death in 1898, by a new route and
heard another party ascending by the older way on
the other side of the mountain.</p>

<p>My pockets had been emptied out before the
start. After these failures I flung away my coat
and tied on to the rope that had been let down from
above. With renewed confidence the fourth attempt
was successful. When the first twelve feet were
passed I found two wedged stones a short distance
above my head. These forced my body out of the
crack altogether, but they offered respectable holds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
during the process. Above these the next pitch
involved a process of backing up, though the chimney
was much too narrow to brace firmly across from
side to side.</p>

<p>I joined the other men at the top after a few
more struggles, breathless and exhausted. Resting a
few moments we descended the Kern Knotts Chimney
and went down to lunch near the spring. Later on,
when I effected the ascent without a rope, a rapid
passage of the worst bit left me with enough reserve
strength to climb up the rest of the way comfortably.
The eighty feet and the descent by the chimney on the
other side were then disposed of in seven minutes.</p>

<p>The remaining passage upwards from the cave is
by the <i>mauvais pas</i> of the ordinary route.</p>

<p>The account of this crack has been given in much
detail. It is the sort of thing for a strong party to
climb on their way out of Wastdale, or some afternoon
after a wet morning’s imprisonment in the
hotel. The danger of the first pitch can be
minimised for the leader by holding him with the
rope from the right-hand recess of the wall. In fact
there is a pinnacle in this recess at about the level of
the niche, which could be utilized as a holding-place.
A shoulder to start from and an ice-axe support in
continuation are certain to be appreciated. Messrs.
Reade and McCulloch have lately shown that the
niche can be reached by the crack. On the worst
bit which immediately follows I expect a steadying
hand from below will be generally necessary.

<p>When a man can go up this without assistance
from above he may well be regarded as fit for the
Grépon crack. This latter is of the same length and
general character. It is easier, but harder to enter,
and it comes after more climbing; moreover, there
may be ice in it to create trouble.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Kern Knotts, West Chimney.</span>&mdash;A note may
here be added concerning the only remaining chimney
on these crags that can claim to be a distinctive
feature visible at a distance. It is about sixty feet
to the north-west (or Wastdale side) of the ordinary
route, and is plainly discernible from the lower part
of the Styhead path. A diminutive cairn now marks
the foot of the chimney; another stands on a flat
ledge a couple of yards above the narrowest and
hardest portion of the climb.</p>

<p>There are two or three ways of reaching the foot
of the main difficulty in the ascent, all converging to
a point about twenty-five feet above the lower cairn.
Here a vertical crack rises abruptly, varying from
ten inches to nothing in width, and terminating ten
feet higher in a right-angled corner of the rocks that
will on no account permit any ‘backing-up.’ For
some distance the recess looks as difficult to tackle
as the corner of a room, and it is only when the
climber gets to a height of fifty feet that his
troubles appear to moderate. One wet day some
twelve months ago our party could make nothing of
the ascent, but shortly after last Easter (1897) I
made another attempt on it. To help me on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
difficult pitch a second man was persuaded to
scramble up to the foot of the crack, as I anticipated
the need of a sturdy shoulder. But the platform on
which I was waiting proved to be much too small for
two, and when, by elevating myself a few feet, it was
safe for him to follow, I was too high to use his
shoulder and had to manage with his encouraging
suggestions and the little excrescences on the right
wall. The first pull up the crack was by an excellent
hold for both hands on the left, using a narrow ledge
with the inner side of the left foot, and the crack
itself for the right thigh. It then became desirable
to turn round so that the outer edge of the left foot
should grip it without losing its support during the
process of turning. This accomplished, the method
of ascent became obvious. Small holds for hands and
feet were distributed regularly up the right wall,
perhaps three ledges for a rise of ten feet. During
the latter part the left hand sought support in the
grassy corner of the chimney, which here began to
open up again. Then a long pull with the arms
brought me up to the flat ledge that marks the finish
of the difficulty. There a cairn was built with the
loose stones that needed shifting, the second man
coming up like a lamplighter to help in the
operation.</p>

<p>Thence our route was partly up the buttress, by
rather exposed ledges, and partly in the chimney.
The rocks were excellent and the open mountain side
was reached in another fifty feet. The climb is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
worthy of Kern Knotts. It is more risky than either
the chimney or the ‘crack,’ but with a steady party
and dry rocks it will go perfectly well. Nevertheless,
I am far from willing to give it an unqualified recommendation.
A slip of the leader on the awkward
part would almost certainly cause the second to be
pulled away from his hold, and the two would have
an objectionable fall over twenty-five feet of steep
rock. But the striking appearance of the difficult
pitch is enough to keep away all weaklings.

<p class="caption">THE SCREES AND WASTWATER</p></div>

<p>Wastwater, the deepest lake in the district,
occupies a flat-bottomed depression in Wastdale. It
is just three miles long, and its very regular shores
somewhat detract from the prettiness of its scenery.
But the wild character of the hills that inclose it
gives it a grandeur that is not possessed to an equal
extent by any of the other lakes in the country.
Its direction is north-east and south-west; Upper
Wastdale is at its northern end. The road up the
valley from Strands runs close to the lake along its
north-western side, and is good enough for driving
or bicycling as far as Wastdale Head. There it
terminates as a driving-road, but paths lead to the
north over the Black Sail Pass and eastwards over
the Styhead. As we walk up the road, Buckbarrow
towers in steep crags a mile away to the left; then
on the same side we skirt the gentler slopes of
Middle Fell, and after crossing Nether Beck, Yewbarrow
exhibits a singular change of outline, from
that of a steep and narrow pyramid to a long level-topped
grassy ridge with no architectural pretensions
whatever. On the other side of the lake is the ridge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
of the Screes, one of the most singular mountains in
Britain. Its highest point is by no means striking to
look at, a matter of 2,000 feet above the sea. For a
length of three miles the ridge is broken away in a
line of cliff of almost uniform height, towering
1,500 feet over the lake. The character of the rock,
and perhaps also an unusually great exposure to
weathering influences, has caused an enormous wear
and tear of the face of the cliff. Thus it is that
huge screes have been formed that flow straight
down into the lake. The action is still going on.
If we take a walk along the edge of the cliff, and
this way of enjoying the round of Wastwater may be
strongly recommended to tourists, we cannot help
noticing that at the heads of the big gullies which
indicate the regions of maximum erosion, slight
preliminary landslips have already occurred. The
grassy ridge is marked in many places by curved
terraces, showing definite subsidence and taking
the general shape of the gully head. A few years
ago a great mass of rock detached itself from the
top of the cliff near its highest point, and thundered
down towards the lake. It happened at night and
nobody was there to see, but the terrific noise gave
serious alarm to the inhabitants of the valley.
It has been estimated that the volume of rock that
broke away was as great as the Manchester Town
Hall, but the comparison is perhaps worth little,
for to many a north-countryman there is nothing
greater than the Manchester Town Hall, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
expression may have been used merely to denote
that the rock-fall was very big. The scar may still
be seen on the face, if one knows where to look for
it; the scree below it appeared fresh for many
months. The rich colouring of red and yellow in
the rocks has caused the scree itself to assume an
astonishing variety of tints, and when viewed in
sunlight the effects are most remarkable.</p>

<p>From the climbing point of view this continual
weathering is altogether unsatisfactory. The rocks
are too uncertain, and in most cases the gullies are
too much occupied by scree. But towards the lower
end of the lake we find that certain different conditions
obtain. The rocks are firmer, there is less scree
at their base, and it shows plainly by its grass
covering that the fresh supply is strictly limited.</p>

<p>The last great bastion of the high ridge rises
opposite Wastdale Hall. It is cut off from the
crags on the left by the Great Gully, which runs up
to the sky-line through a height of a thousand
feet. On the right a slighter gully practically
indicates the end of the precipitous portion of the
face. Cutting deeply into the centre of the bastion
itself is a third gully that is continued straight on
to the sky-line; if anything it is a few feet shorter
than the Great Gully, though much more difficult to
climb. I propose to describe these two only. From
all accounts it would appear that they represent fully
the satisfactory routes up the Screes. The sketch
in Haskett Smith’s book shows them as B and C (the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
reader can let B stand for ‘big’ and C for ‘central’).
That which is marked A in his sketch is no climb at
all. It is just a gully and nothing more, but it was
not quite so worthy of being labelled as the next
great one to the left.</p>

<p>The B gully was first climbed in the winter of
1891-2 by Messrs. Collie, Hastings, and Robinson,
and an interesting account of the ascent, contributed
by Dr. Collie, appeared in the ‘Scottish Mountaineering
Journal’ for January, 1894. A year later Mr.
Mummery made the second ascent. Not so long
afterwards Robinson showed me the way up with a
large party of enthusiasts, whose strength and nerve
were pretty well exhausted by the time we dragged
ourselves over the last pitch.</p>

<p>Concerning the early history of the attempts on
the C gully I have not been able to gather much
information. Many parties have started up it with
the impression that they were undertaking the Great
Gully, but they never succeeded in finishing it. On
April 19, 1895, Messrs. Lawrence, Simpson, and
Patchell, made a magnificent assault on it, and by
the merest accident they had to give in almost at
the moment of success. They climbed seven pitches,
the gully getting harder at each successive pitch.
Then, when worn out with fatigue and exposure to
wet and cold, they misjudged the difficulty of the
ninth pitch. It is certainly most formidable to look
at from below the eighth, but on closer examination
its difficulties vanish. That is to say, they become
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
insignificant for a party that can get over the
seventh pitch. They saw two more huge obstacles
looming above the ninth, and were completely disheartened.
There happened to be an easy exit on
the left, and they took to it. Once or twice since
that date others have tried the gully again, but
without effecting any further advance. In April,
1897, Mr. H. C. Bowen accompanied me from Wastdale
in an attempt. Circumstances favoured us
throughout, and the gully yielded to our attack. I
believe it is one of the hardest climbs that either of
us has yet effected in Cumberland, but that may be
because it is one of the most recent. Before
attempting it visitors to the district should see first
if they can comfortably manage the B gully.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Great Gully of the Screes (B).</span>&mdash;The
usual way of reaching it from Wastdale Head is by
the road as far as the second field beyond Wastdale
Hall. There a path across the bridge can be found,
and the course of the stream followed up to the lake
side. The foot of the gully is reached in fifteen
minutes by bearing obliquely upwards across ancient
scree. Its aspect is such as to directly face the
small peninsula across the water a trifle to the left
of the Hall. The right edge of the gully extends
further downwards than the left, and a small stream
of water is usually finding its way down the rough
scree bed.</p>

<p>A few feet up we reach the first obstacle, in the
shape of a broken waterfall altogether about thirty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
feet high. It is usual to take to the steep grass on
the left, a route that looks easier than it actually is.
When the soil is damp the earth comes away like
sand, and there is little reliability in the holds all
the way up. We step with relief into the bed of the
gully again, and look up to see what the prospect is.
An easy slope leads towards a second waterfall, considerably
higher than the first. Ordinarily there is
no chance of surmounting it directly, but a way of
avoiding it discloses itself as we approach. The
gully divides into two, the main portion being to the
left, and a fine branch passing up to a height of 150
feet on the right. We start by climbing the first
pitch in the branch gully&mdash;a narrow vertical corner
in the wall down which a vigorous spout of water
jets like a hydrant. There are a few ledges on the
left side which enable us to avoid some of the water,
but if there has been much rain before our expedition
it is impossible to keep dry during the ascent.</p>

<p>It was here that I saw a sinful act of revenge
that grieved me much at the time. My companions
had been with me up the Scawfell Pinnacle by the
Deep Ghyll route on the previous day, and one had
kept the others in painful attitudes on the cliff
while he leisurely proceeded to photograph us. The
partner of my woes vowed vengeance, and exacted
it here on the Screes. His turn it was to manipulate
the camera, and his wicked malice prompted him to
insist on taking a photograph when his brother was
half-way up the corner. We had given him the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
right of choosing his subject and could not complain,
especially as he was loud in his praise of the view
and in his grief at his brother’s cramped and
drenched condition. But he was in good humour
for the rest of the day, and that was worth paying
for.</p>

<p>The position now is that a buttress separates us
from the main gully. We have to clamber a few
feet up this, next along a shallow, sloping scoop as
far as it goes, and then traverse across to the head of
the big fall. The leader is not able to derive much
help from the rope in case of a slip, but it is as well
for the second man to climb thirty feet up the right
wall of the branch gully, so as to be higher than
the pioneer. The buttress looks much broken from
below, but the general slope is to our disadvantage,
and the final traverse is along a crumbling ledge
of earth and grass. Frost occasionally makes the
climbing easier, by binding the earth firmly to the
rock.</p>

<p>The view across the lake from the top of the
waterfall is very beautiful. The rich dark green of
the pines that grow down to the water’s edge on the
other side form a striking contrast to the gaunt and
barren walls of black rock that close in the view.
Buckbarrow fills up the background, the severity of
its seamed precipices softened by distance.</p>

<p>The branch gully, it may here be mentioned, has
never been climbed throughout. It ends on the
bastion at no great height above us, and is probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
not very stiff. I tried it one Christmas Day with
Messrs. Robinson and Fowler, but we rose no higher
than the little notch on the thin curtain of rock that
forms its right boundary. We got soaked in the
little waterfall, and the bitter cold drove us back unsuccessful.
We had difficulties with the awkward
chimney above the narrow corner.</p>

<p>Keeping up the main gully, an easy stretch takes
us to the third pitch. It is a water-slide, and we must
hurry up quickly if dryness is still any consideration.
The best way is on the left. There are many holds
under the water, and our efforts to prevent its trickling
down our arms will be futile if we get flurried by nasty
remarks from those behind. Almost before we can
gain breath again we are confronted by a similar difficulty.
The water-slide here is taken first on the right,
until a slanting crack leads across to the other side.
The climbing is rather stiff near the top, and careful
search should be made for the safest footholds.</p>

<p>The fifth pitch that we now approach is generally
regarded as the hardest. It is undoubtedly difficult
when taken by the route first discovered. A long
wet slope of rock divides the gully into two parts.
On the right there seems little likelihood of finding a
way up. The great overhanging slabs are fifty feet
high, and water is continually pouring down them.
On the left the chance of success is greater. A
slanting crack lies between the rock slope and the
side wall. It leads straight up to a hole underneath
a huge overhanging boulder that dominates the pitch.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
There we can see a choice of route. The way first
adopted is to wriggle up the chimney between the
boulder and the left wall; but it is preferable
to crawl out of the hole to the right and make an
exit over rounded boulders to the top of the obstacle.
The chimney is extremely stiff, the main difficulty
being to make a start from the hole. If the cave
had a level bottom the difficulties would be much
moderated. There are no holds on the boulder itself
and very few on the side wall, but those few make it
worth while starting with the face to the wall. Six
feet higher, when the climber is in the most exposed
situation, he must turn half round and use both sides
of the chimney. If the leader cannot get into the crack
unassisted, it is a good plan for the second to hitch
himself to a jammed boulder at the back of the cave
and proffer a shoulder as a take-off. The first explorers
had ice to contend against and proceeded in a
still more cautious manner, all three combining their
strength at the awkward corner. I have three times
seen men swing off on the rope when half way up the
chimney, and am bound to admit that there is too
much touch-and-go for the way to suit any but very
strong climbers. The easier way out of the hole&mdash;first
taken, I think, by Messrs. Whitaker and Thorp&mdash;seems
to reduce the difficulty considerably, and
will probably become a favourite exit.</p>

<p>Above the fifth pitch we step out into a huge
amphitheatre of rock. It is difficult to decide which
is the main gully, and many men are willing to conclude
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
that there is no more hard work in front,
and that a speedy passage out of the hollow will
conduce most to their happiness.</p>

<p>The real gully passes up on the left. A branch
starts pleasantly enough to the right, but after one
or two fairly easy pitches we are confronted by a
blank, wet wall. The sides are steep and spiky and
rotten; it was a most miserable hour I once spent
getting over forty feet of this dreadful <i>cul-de-sac</i>, and
ever since I have solemnly warned others from any
such attempt to shirk the final part of the Great Gully.
If they wish to get out, they should keep still more
to the right, over steep grass and occasional slight
rock. Traversing in a westerly or south-westerly
direction, they pass across the heads of several gullies,
above the worst portion of the C gully, and then out
on the fell side, whence an easy run takes them down
to the bridge.</p>

<p>The three or four pitches that must be overcome
in mounting to the head of the true Great Gully are
short but difficult. The ghyll is narrow and wet
and it is almost impossible towards the finish to
avoid a drenching by the slender stream that
monopolizes the direct route. The last pitch is
ordinarily circumvented by passing up the nasty
wall of loose earth and rocky <i>débris</i> on the left.
This diversion leads on to an easy broken buttress
from which we can walk into the gully again and up
its scree finish to the crest of the precipice.</p>

<p>On the occasion of my first ascent we were four
and a half hours in the gully. A second expedition to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
the top of the fifth pitch took three hours; and half
that time was spent at photography.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Central Gully (C).</span>&mdash;Bowen and I had
been climbing together for some days last Easter
(1897), and were reserving an attempt on the C gully
for the latter end of our holiday, to give ourselves the
chance of getting into good form and the place an
opportunity for drying up.</p>

<p>One fine morning we heard that another party were
driving down the valley on their way to the Great
Gully. They offered us seats in their wagonette. We
gladly accepted, and had a pleasant drive along the
lakeside as far as Wastdale Hall. The walk round to
the foot of our climb occupied us the best part of
half an hour, and we then left our friends to continue
their journey, arranging to look out for them at the
top of the Screes a few hours later.</p>

<p>The gully was easy at the outset, but far up above
us we could see difficulties in plenty, and we began
the scramble with a sense of future bliss that rather
detracted from our present enjoyment.</p>

<p>We passed up on the left-hand side of the first
pitch at 11-18, over fifteen feet of steep grass and
rock. The holds were fairly good beside the waterfall.
A few feet further on the gully narrowed at a
second pitch&mdash;a steep gutter down which the stream
endeavoured to smooth a way. We could use ledges
on either side, and at the top a tree-stem that has lain
there for some years gave us assistance. The pitch
is about twenty-five feet high.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>

<p>Then there followed two easy ten-feet bits before
we found ourselves compelled at the fifth pitch to
quit the bed of the gully. This obstacle sent us
off to the left up a steep grass bank before we could
traverse back into the narrow chimney at an assailable
spot. We were obliged to use our knees for
wedging safely in the V-shaped corner, and thus had
our introduction to the water-way. The ledges were
few and slippery. Ten feet up the corner a jammed
stone and a slippery slab guarded the head of the
pitch. We reached the former actually behind the
water, and hastened out to the left with but slight
steadying holds for the hands.</p>

<p>Then we halted a little and looked about us.
We had gone through the preliminaries, and realized
that our gully was now getting stiff. The view
upwards showed the great seventh pitch, but nothing
higher. Far below we could see the end of the lake.
The prospect was not nearly so fine as that from the
Great Gully; the rocks were not so boldly carved
out, nor the outlook so fair.</p>

<p>The next obstacle was formed by a jammed
boulder thirty feet high, impossible to climb direct.
It would perhaps have been best to take it on the
right, but we advanced tentatively up the other side,
and then, seeing that it would just go, kept on to the
top. Our route lay up the narrow crack between
the boulder and the side wall. A shoulder was
useful for the leader at the start, but he had a bad
six feet just above. The only hold for the right hand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
was obtained by clenching the fist inside the crack
so as to form a wedge. A far-away notch in the wall
gave an oblique push-off for the left foot, the struggle
being mainly to keep close to the crack.</p>

<p>The difficulties now became almost continuous,
and we were unable to define exactly the beginning
of the seventh pitch. Some twenty feet of steep
climbing up the bed of the ghyll first followed
and we reached a little platform whence a branch
gully of steep grass led out on the buttress to
our left. The main gully was thirty feet across,
narrowing a little higher up. An almost vertical
rib of rock some six feet thick divided the gully
into two parts. That on the right was a wide
recess roofed in by a great stone nearly a
hundred feet overhead. From our little platform
we could see the water streaming over the edge
of the roof, and forming a thin veil at the entrance
to the cave. The left-hand side of the rib was a
narrow crack sloping back at an angle of about 45°,
but after the first thirty feet continuing to the top
perpendicularly. The route we chose lay first up the
crack, then across the rib and into the cave. A
second start being made from there, we proposed to
climb up the vertical rib, taking to the crack on its
left whenever the difficulties became extreme. At the
level of the roof of the cavern we were to traverse
across on to it and make directly up its smooth slope
and round by the left of a higher jammed block that
overhung the finishing portion of the pitch. I think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
the route differs a little from that of the first party,
who were somewhat assisted by a jammed stone then
in the crack. In fact one member considered the
stone essential for a successful ascent, and that its
untimely removal closed the upper half for ever.
But there can be no doubt that in a dry season the
obstacle can be overcome by a moderately strong
party, and that in the normal ‘streamy’ state of the
gully the climber needs but the knowledge of a
route and the nerve to follow it without hesitation
and without regard to dryness.</p>

<p>We found the way easy up to the cave. There
Bowen braced himself firmly amidst the bright green
ferns and endeavoured to reconcile himself to the
prospect of a long wait. He could not trace out my
route upwards, for the curtain of water was between
us, but now and again when troubles were thickest
he would inquire feelingly after my condition.</p>

<p>It was straightforward climbing out from the cave
and up to the vertical buttress. But the absence of
suitable holds in the crack on the left made the next
twenty feet very severe, and I was glad to find at
last a series of ledges across to the top of the cave.
The holds were wet and my fingers benumbed. If
the ledges had been anything but satisfactory the
traverse would have been highly incorrect, not to
say immoral. Then the rope had to be lengthened
out and the wait was unpleasant. But the rock
slope was a much simpler matter than it had appeared
to be from below, and the rest of the pitch was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
scarcely more than a walk. I drew up over the last
block with much relief, and paused to recover warmth
and feeling before drawing in the rope for Bowen.
He climbed with great rapidity and practically left
out the traverse; it was rather vexatious to find
that he emerged fresh and comparatively dry. It
was now 12-34 <small>P.M.</small>, and so far we had advanced
rapidly.</p>

<p>A few feet in front was a long thin crack, looking
easy but proving awkward at close quarters. We
found it best to traverse up the smooth slab on the
left and then crawl along a rickety ledge of grass and
rock back to the gully again. Were we nevermore
to find an easy piece? Almost at once a ninth pitch
faced us, looking somewhat like the eighth. The
gully suddenly narrows to a V-groove which springs
up vertically for twelve feet, then slopes away at 45°
for twenty feet, and finally is blocked by a few
boulders before widening out again. Just before the
constriction occurs, the walls of the ravine slope
outwards at an easy angle, and the tangle of thickly-matted
grass disguises the treacherous character of
the rock underneath. This has been splintered and
loosened by frost and sturdy vegetation. Great
masses in many steep places are ready to fall at a
touch, and scrambling is robbed of its pleasures
by the sense of possible insecurity of every available
hold. I tried at first to keep up the crack,
but just at the corner where it trends obliquely
upwards the difficulties of holding on proved too
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
great and a cautious descent had to be effected.
Then we looked to the left up a steep little gully
fifty feet high. It ended abruptly in the main
wall of the ravine, but a great splinter of rock at the
highest corner gave us a chance of belaying. Bowen
clambered gingerly over the broken ground and tied
himself to the rock. Then, slipping my rope round
it, he prepared to hold me during the next move.
Our plan was to clamber up the loose face on the
left of the awkward pitch and traverse into the gully
twenty-five feet higher. My rope was dragging
along the wall, and would have dislodged a good
deal if suddenly called upon to break my fall. The
worst bit was the last six feet of traverse, which I
very much loosened during the passage. The gully
was then bestridden and both sides used for the
finishing portion of the pitch. When Bowen came
along, the traverse broke away at his touch, and it
was rather alarming to see him start falling backwards.
But the rope was tight above him and he
simply swung round into the gully; it was the most
expeditious mode of entering, but he bruised his leg
a little at the final bump. We afterwards agreed
that the second man ought to take the whole
obstacle direct. Trying to repeat the ascent again
in April, 1898, by exactly the same manœuvres, the
slight remnant of traverse broke away with me and
I had a bad fall. I was saved, of course, by the
rope. The direct ascent of the watercourse has
been proved to be possible, and is now much the
better way.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<p>Such was the ninth pitch, probably the one
misjudged by Dr. Lawrence’s party on April 9,
1895. They had taken four hours to climb to the
eighth, remarkably good going when one considers
the bad condition of the gully during their ascent
and the amount of new ground they managed to
cover. We had mounted in a little less than an
hour and three quarters; but we were only a small
party and the circumstances very favourable. They
saw a hundred-feet pitch following on a few yards
higher and endeavoured to estimate its difficulties.
From below the aspect is terrifying, and after a
slight survey they decided to work out of the ravine
by an easy exit up the left wall. Thence they saw
a few more pitches higher up beyond the tenth, and
were convinced that they had done right. But they
were mistaken, as our experience proved.</p>

<p>A little direct scrambling up the bed of the
gully took us to the foot of the great obstacle. A
water-shoot splashes on to the left wall eighty feet
up, and is deflected into the cavernous depths of
a black recess formed in the gully by a long buttress
that divides it into two parts. The climb up
through the splashing water appears to be almost
hopeless, and a view from above of the last twenty
feet shows that the risk would be extreme if the
pitch were attacked on that side. But the buttress
will be found on inspection to close in a sort of
chimney on the right, fairly easy to reach and most
comfortable to follow up to its finish three feet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
above the level of the top of the waterfall. This
branch chimney is safe and dry. There are no loose
stones about, and the occasional glimpses of the
furious shoot over the way are very pleasing. They
were so to us, at any rate, who had been in fear and
trembling lest we should be compelled to attack the
pitch through the waterfall. We were surprised at
our good fortune, and none the less on seeing that the
difficulties above were insignificant. A short scree
and an easy twelve-feet obstacle brought us up to the
well-known traverse across the face of the mountain.</p>

<p>We could hear occasional shouting of our friends
in the Great Gully. It tempted us to work over to
them and finish on the final chimneys of their climb.
But we felt constrained to keep straight up, lest
any further pitches should linger unclimbed. The
C gully was to acknowledge itself vanquished from
beginning to end, and we set ourselves to finish
the task. Little actually remained. A steep climb
of thirty feet, using both sides of the gully, with poor
holds near the top, virtually brought us to an end of
its interesting and extended series of pitches. A
scramble up the last water-slide and a muddy slope
led to the long scree finish, and we emerged at the
summit shortly after two o’clock. The walk home
over Ill Fell took an hour and a half.

<span class="large"><i>PAVEY ARK</i></span></h2>

<p>The Langdale Pikes form a beautiful group of hills
four miles to the east of the Scawfell Pikes. They
lie at the head of Langdale, and the highest point,
Harrison Stickle, is a prominent object in many a
favourite landscape.</p>

<p>Harrison Stickle is splendidly shaped, and
manages to give an impression of much greater height
than it really possesses (2,401 feet). Half a mile to the
west is the Pike of Stickle or the Sugarloaf. It has
a little climbing on the west face. Mr. Gwynne writes
of it thus: ‘The Sugarloaf itself is a very fine peak,
that, viewed from the valley, has very much the
appearance of the Mönch. It runs down towards
the Stake Pass in a spur, which must be the starting-point
of most of the climbs on this mountain. There
is a curious gully here, which is worthy of the
climber’s attention. It does not run from top to
bottom, but suddenly begins about the middle of the
crag. The difficulty is to get at this gully, and some
pretty climbing can be obtained in the attempt.’</p>

<p>Somewhat south of the mid-point between
Harrison Stickle and the Sugarloaf is the summit of
Gimmer Crag. It overlooks the old hotel of Dungeon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
Ghyll, and offers in dry weather a considerable
amount of indiscriminate scrambling.</p>

<p class="caption">THE PAVEY ARK GULLIES FROM STICKLE TARN</p></div>

<p>One of the finest little tarns of the district lies
900 feet below the summit of Harrison Stickle, on its
north-east side. Stickle Tarn is almost as solitary as
Easedale, and its surroundings are decidedly finer.
It is about an hour’s walk from Dungeon Ghyll, by
a small footpath keeping close to the stream that
is fed by the lake waters. The view across the tarn
is a delight to climbers’ eyes. The great cliffs of
Pavey Ark, rising 700 feet above the lake, are
darkly reflected in the still waters. They are deeply
cut by two gullies that immediately arrest attention.
Each marks a little notch in the sky-line. A third
notch further to the left indicates the head of a
slighter indentation in the face of the cliff, which, so
far as I know, has not yet been explored. The right-hand
‘Great’ Gully was first climbed by Haskett
Smith in the summer of 1882. The left, called the
‘Little’ Gully by way of antithesis, the same climber
explored in June, 1886. A lady ascended the Great
Gully in 1887, and later years have seen a steady
succession of visitors to these crags.</p>

<p>Well towards the north end of the cliff is a wide
scree gully with a square notch at its crest. Near
the foot of this a safe natural path may be followed
obliquely across the face. This is the well-known
Jack’s Rake. It starts rather steeply, but soon
assumes a gentle, uniform gradient. It crosses the
Great Gully a hundred feet below the top; there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
then follows a rather awkward bit for the walker,
who will need to scramble up a corner to get on to
the last portion of the rake. It crosses the Little
Gully within fifty feet of the Summit, and ends on the
buttress just beyond. Two chimneys spring from the
level of Jack’s Rake to the north of the Great Gully,
which both look interesting. Our pleasant scramble
is thus described by Gwynne: ‘This ledge [i.e. Jack’s
Rake] offers a multitude of good opportunities to
the climber. It runs obliquely across the face of
the precipice, but it need not necessarily be followed
throughout its length by the mountaineer who wishes
for something a little more exciting. About half-way
up there runs on to the ledge a chimney which&mdash;when
it is not a small waterfall&mdash;forms a pleasant
climb to some broken rock above, whence the
summit is easily reached. If, however, the water in
the chimney makes it uncomfortable and unpleasant
for the climber, he may still arrive at the top of it
by choosing a long bit of steep, smooth rock on the
left. There are two clefts which afford fairly good
hand-and-foot holds, and from there the top of the
chimney is attained.’</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Little Gully.</span>&mdash;Some six years ago I paid
my first visit to Pavey Ark. The accounts of the Great
Gully were very enticing. One visitor spoke of it as
having only one pitch, ‘but that was severe.’ Another,
commenting on the first, remarked: ‘Yes! it has only
one pitch, but that one lasts all the way up!’ Then a
celebrated climber had estimated its height at double
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
the actual amount, which was a testimonial to its
good qualities all the more acceptable because it was
given unconsciously.</p>

<p>There were tales of a leader pawing about for
half an hour on the second man’s head and shoulders,
in search of holds. Gloves and sticks and other
impedimenta were understood to lie in profusion
at the foot of the stiffest bit, left there by those
who could climb no higher, or those who sadly
expected that after their despairing attempts had
failed they would have no further need for such
articles. In short, there was a good deal of pernicious
exaggeration concerning the Great Gully,
and I went for it expecting great things. It was
rather a long walk from Wastdale, over Great End
and Bowfell. The descent to Dungeon Ghyll was
taken for the sake of a look-in at the waterfall, and
for the next half-hour hurrying up to Stickle Tarn, I
felt to the full the futility of having run down from
Bowfell to Langdale to save time. Arrived at the
small dam that holds in the waters of the lake, I
saw the two gullies on the other side, and concluding
that the left-hand one looked harder, skirted the
lake, and made for its foot. It was a foolish mistake,
thus to confuse the two routes. The Little Gully
was ascended that day, and until Haskett Smith’s
book came out three years later, describing the
locality in some detail, I fondly imagined that I
knew the best thing on Pavey Ark.</p>

<p>The gully is narrow at first. Its walls are red in
colour, and a film of water generally covers them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
The holds are not particularly good, and the steepness
of the gully renders extreme caution necessary. Both
walls are used, and our advance is after the fashion of
a man on a ladder. Then the gully widens, and the
difficulties come in successive steps till a great overhanging
boulder blocks the direct ascent. Here the
right wall is sufficiently broken to offer a method of
circumventing the pitch, but in wet weather the
place is bad. Just above this I found a stick, conclusive
evidence to the simple mind that the hard
bit of the Great Gully was now being approached.
It looked as though it had been there for years.
The view backwards was most impressive, the tarn
appearing almost beneath my feet. The second
obstacle was now to be considered. The gully
narrowed to a thin vertical corner plastered over
with wet green moss. The take-off was earthy and
disagreeably loose. The only holds were on the right
wall near the corner, and were few and far between.
I hesitated below for a long time, scarcely knowing
how best to start operations. A big jammed stone
came away in my hands as I made a first attempt,
and crashed down the gully from side to side. At
last I rammed the left knee tentatively into the wet
corner, and edged up a few feet with the aid of
sundry slight supports for the right foot. Ten feet
higher an excellent hold was reached with the hand,
and the chief trouble was over. Huge boulders were
piled overhead confusedly, but they gave plenty of
opportunities, and no longer had the smooth, almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
shiny surface that characterized the rocks further
down. The top of the gully was reached three
quarters of an hour after starting. It was half-past
five, and snow was beginning to fall; I thought it
desirable to hurry, and a steady trot westwards
round the head of Langdale Combe and the further
side of Black Crags brought me in three miles to the
path at the Angle Tarn and the foot of the up-grade
towards Esk Hause. Thence a steady two hours’
walk in the dark brought me safely to Wastdale, in
happy ignorance of the fact that I had only visited
the Little Gully. But to this day I think it as hard
as its neighbour.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Great Gully.</span>&mdash;Shortly after Easter, 1896,
I begged some friends to come over and climb the
Great Gully with me. It was my last day at Wastdale;
I was due at Coniston the same evening, and
the Langdale Pikes offered a pleasanter walk to the
Old Man district than is given by the Eskdale and
Cockley Beck route. My friends stipulated that we
should call a halt at Kern Knotts on the way out
and attempt the ‘crack.’ This we managed with
expedition, and continued the journey betimes over
the Styhead and Esk Hause.</p>

<p>The three miles from Angle Tarn to Pavey Ark
are rather tedious, though the view of Bowfell and
of Pike of Stickle relieves the monotony. It is a
wild open moor that we have to cross, and its gentle
slope is very deceptive. For a long time the sky-line
in front of us, after rounding Langdale Combe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
at the top of the Stake Pass, recedes as we advance,
and it is not till the grassy ridge of Thunacar Knott
is gained that we begin to see the upper crags of
Pavey Ark. Nevertheless it is much better to
approach the crags in this way from the Wastdale
direction than to descend first towards Dungeon
Ghyll. The great rocks strewn about the crest of
the cliff are most singular in character. Their surface
is as rough as that of the magnesian limestone
in the Dolomites. If only the whole face of Pavey
Ark were of this formation we should have a fine
opportunity for practice with the scarpetti or rope-soled
shoes used by the Tyrolese rock-climbers.</p>

<p>We descended towards the tarn by an easy slope
between the cliff and the north-east ridge of Harrison
Stickle. Then at the level of the base of the crags
we crossed a water-course, and traversed over the
scree to the foot of the Great Gully, passing the
entrance to the other on our way. The remarks
already made, and reference to the diagram on page
203, will perhaps give sufficient indication of the
place at which we now found ourselves. In misty
weather the locality can be identified by the branch
gully to the left, that starts at once and loses itself
200 feet higher up.</p>

<p>The lower part of the climb very much resembles
the corresponding portion in the other gully. The
side walls are close together, the rock is steep, and
hand-and-foot scrambling fairly continuous for about
150 feet. When the rocks are wet some special
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
care is necessary at a place thirty feet from the
starting-point. Then comes the first pitch, a remarkably
fine piece of rock scenery. An enormous boulder
completely blocks the way, projecting at least fifteen
feet at its upper part. The left wall is practically
hopeless, but the other side shows a series of small
ledges that enable the climber to work up to the
flat corner between the boulder and the right wall.
Formerly this bit was grassy. Only a few small
tufts now remain, and the holds are therefore more
obvious. A pleasanter way lies through the cave
and out by a narrow tunnel in the roof to the same
flat corner, which is just discernible from below.
That way our party followed. The dripping water
from the roof was a trifle unpleasant sometimes, but
there was a great sense of security in adopting the
through route. The tunnel required careful going
until one’s eyes got accustomed to the darkness.
Then the handholds could be distinguished and the
platform reached in safety.</p>

<p>The view outwards was most brilliant. Sunlight
on the distant range of Fairfield and Helvellyn, the
serpentine Windermere appearing here and there far
away to the south; Langdale in all its loveliness,
with the watch-tower of Harrison Stickle at its
head; and the gloomy Stickle Tarn 500 feet beneath
us. Our own situation was sufficiently striking for
the recollection of this pitch to remain impressed on
our memories. We stood (one at a time, by the
way) on the very edge of the overhanging eaves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
of the huge cave beneath. The side walls of the
gully seemed to cut us off from all communication
with the world. We could only realize the solid
platform and the enduring rock to which we hung;
all the rest might have been a fantasy. Even the
bold fisherman down by the shores of the tarn, slowly
manipulating his rod as he cautiously waded knee-deep
in the water, seemed to belong to another
species. It was incredible that I should be crossing
London within twenty-four hours; and the thought
of it only stirred slightly in my mind, without
actually shaping itself until this present time of
writing.</p>

<p>The difficulty was not quite passed. To reach
the top of the pitch we had to haul ourselves up
a tight little corner between the boulder and the
side wall. Formerly the headroom was so limited
that it was necessary to keep out a little, and effect a
rather sensational haul over the front of the boulder.
Since the first ascent a piece of rock has fallen away,
and the corner is easier. There is no actual danger
for the leader, as his rope can be securely held in the
interior of the cave. In fact, he may, if he chooses,
obtain any desired assistance from the second man
properly belayed on the platform. The corner is only
ten feet high and the rocks are very good.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the first pitch the gully
undergoes a great change in appearance. It still
remains narrow, but the bed has alternately vertical
and horizontal stretches of wet and slippery rock. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
hardest piece is generally regarded as the second pitch.
It consists of a long slab thirty feet high, constituting
the true bed of the ghyll and the only available way
up. It is set at a steep angle, and appears to be
singularly devoid of useful holds. On the occasion
of the first ascent it was ‘lubricated by a film of fine
mud,’ and our own observations gave strength to
the conviction that such was its usual condition.
Loose gravel is being continually washed down the
incline, lodging in a most annoying manner on the
best holds. Small wonder that this ‘brant and slape’
part gives pause to many climbers. Yet it has been
climbed even when ice is about, thanks no doubt to
good nails and cool judgment. We treated the pitch
with the utmost respect, carefully clearing away the
grit from each little ledge and working as close to
the corner as the holds would permit. Fifteen feet
up we passed the worst spot, ugly to look at but
not bad enough to turn us back. Then the slope
eased off and we could walk up grass and scree on to
Jack’s Rake, a hundred feet above the pitch. The
rake really terminates the gully. To the left is a
small chimney forming a genuine little obstacle to an
advance along the rake. That was certainly no
suitable finish to our climb. A few yards to the
right showed what we wanted, a gully that should
lead out to the top of Pavey Ark. We found the rocks
there presented the rough surface that characterised
the boulders up above. There were several great slabs
blocking our way at first, but it was a real delight to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
get over them. A short and narrow chimney followed,
with such gripping powers that our clothes clung to
the sides tenaciously. As Haskett Smith remarks, ‘it
would be quite difficult to make a slip on them.’
Then we walked out to the top, three-quarters of an
hour after entering the gully, and while leisurely
coiling up my rope we discussed the question of tea.
Should the others accept my invitation to Dungeon
Ghyll and then return to Wastdale at dusk, or should
they make straight for Wastdale at once? To my
sorrow they objected to the suggested extension of
their walk and strode off to the west. My own course
lay first to the foot of the crags, where my rücksack
had been left, and thence to Dungeon Ghyll and
Coniston.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Rake End Chimney.</span>&mdash;Besides the third
chimney described by Gwynne as running half-way
up on to the ledge, there is a short but excellent
route up the crags starting near the foot of Jack’s
Rake. The following note was supplied by Mr.
Claude Barton:&mdash;‘The climb is in two pitches, the
first being broken up into places where you can play
up a second man. The <i>mauvais pas</i> is just at the
top of this. A moss-grown wall and two jammed
stones must be surmounted, and the leader may need
some support. The second pitch is a fine chimney
blocked by a large stone that is passed by the
interior, and then used as a take-off for the final easy
concluding portion. The climb is certainly harder
than the Great Gully.’

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="large"><i>DOE CRAG, CONISTON</i></span></h2>

<p>This happy hunting-ground for the rock-climber
is within an hour’s walk of Coniston. It forms part
of the range of hills that includes Wetherlam and the
Old Man, but unlike these great neighbours it has
hitherto been left untouched by miners and quarry-men.</p>

<p>From the Old Man we may look westwards across
the upper end of Goat’s Water, and see the summit
of Doe Crag almost at our level, some 900 feet
above the lake. We are facing its grand precipices,
and are in an excellent position to prospect the
various gullies that cut deeply into the 500-feet wall
of rock.</p>

<p>The first of these, as we glance from left to right,
causes the greatest impression in the sky-line, but is
of the least interest to mountaineers. It is an easy
scree gully, possessing a rotten pinnacle that was first
climbed by Mr. Slingsby in 1887. The second is
generally known as the Great Gully. It is much
longer, and includes a fair amount of genuine hard
work in its ascent. At a distance it appears to have
a Y shape, by reason of the two branches that diverge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
from a point about half-way up. The Great Gully
was first climbed in July, 1888, by Messrs. Hastings,
Haskett Smith, and E. Hopkinson, its first pitch
being then taken by the ‘shallow scoop’ on the left of
the great obstacle. Nearly a year later the brothers
Hopkinson effected a direct ascent of the pitch by an
ingenious utilization of the rope, to which we shall
refer subsequently.</p>

<p>To the immediate north of the Great Gully we
see a huge buttress that springs further down the
scree towards Goat’s Water than any other part of
the crag. The lower 300 feet of this buttress exhibit
a nearly vertical gully that may escape detection
altogether unless viewed in a favourable light. In
the view on the opposite page it is well marked by
the deep black shadow of the rocks on its south side.
Apparently it joins a sloping gully that leads up to
the sky-line; but in reality it finishes abruptly on
the face, at a small grass platform that stretches
a hundred feet across the buttress. It is now
known as the Central Chimney, and was first
climbed in April, 1897, by Mr. Godfrey Ellis and
myself. In the first edition of this book, the chimney
was erroneously identified with one of Messrs.
Hopkinson’s ascents of April, 1895. The route cannot
be recommended except to experts, by reason equally
of the genuine difficulties in the chimney and of the
exposed nature of the awkward situations in it.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Doe Crag and Goatswater</span></p>

<p class="small">(<i>Face page 220</i>)</p></div>

<p>The next gully to the right forms the northern
boundary of the great central buttress. It is but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
slightly marked at the lower end and possesses serious
difficulties in the first half. We shall call it the
Intermediate Gully. It was first climbed in April,
1895, by Messrs. Campbell, and Edward, Albert,
and J. H. Hopkinson, and described by the most
experienced of their party as the severest climb he
had done in the district. Mr. W. J. Williams and I
went up it at Easter, 1898, when making a fairly
complete survey of all these splendid, but practically
unknown gullies.</p>

<p>The Easter Gully now needs localization. It
comes next to the preceding and is easy to identify.
It has a huge cave pitch near the bottom, then from
a great hollow in the crags a vertical chimney springs
up over a hundred feet in a right-angled corner;
above this the gully divides into two branches, both
of which give good climbing until we are nearly at
the summit-ridge. Careful inquiry enables me to
say that this was first climbed by Messrs. Haskett
Smith and Robinson in 1886; they avoided a considerable
amount of the trouble, inevitable in a
passage of the lower half of the direct ascent, by
working up the great buttress on the right, and by
traversing back into the gully when the opportunity
disclosed itself. The first passage of the gully by
the extremely difficult second pitch, and thence
directly onwards, was made on Easter Day, 1895,
by Messrs. Otto Koecher and Charles Hopkinson,
who, however, circumvented the comparatively
simple cave pitch at the foot. They thought they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
were on entirely new ground; so did I when on
Easter Day, 1898, Mr. W. J. Williams accompanied
me over the first pitch, up a zig-zag course to left
and right of the long chimney, and then along the
direct finish to the summit.</p>

<p>The sixth and last great gully is known as the
North Gully, to see which it is necessary to go well
towards Goat’s Hause. Three huge boulders block
up the middle and form the only pitch. The gully
was formerly supposed to be Messrs. Haskett Smith
and Robinson’s climb of 1886; actually it is the
place where Haskett Smith was let down on a rope,
and gave tribute to the grandeur of the region by
remarking on its ‘terrific aspect.’ In 1895 a party
went up what they called the North Gully, but they
encountered no difficulty during their ascent, and it
seems more likely therefore that they climbed a
slighter ghyll between the real North Gully and the
Easter Gully. They traversed into the latter above
its difficult chimney. It is hard to say what exploration
has been made here. Mr. Williams and I
descended the gully in 1898, and halted there
sufficiently to convince ourselves of the feasibility of
its ascent. But whether the climb has ever been
taken upwards throughout its whole length is an
open question.</p>

<p>Climbers should visit Doe Crag more frequently.
The rocks give magnificent sport, the scenery is more
than ordinarily impressive even to the hardened
cragsman, and there yet remains a great amount of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
exploratory work to be done. Only the gullies have
hitherto been tackled. The buttresses are almost
untouched.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Great Gully.</span>&mdash;The satisfactory part of this
climb is that its greatest difficulty confronts us at the
outset. Once the first pitch is accomplished we are
perfectly certain that the combined skill of the party
is sufficient to insure a successful ascent of the
remainder. There is no gradual increase in the
technical difficulty of the subsequent passages, to vex
the soul of the conscientious climber with doubts as
to the morality of advancing, when a critical position
might be reached where descent is dangerous and
further ascent beyond his powers. The first pitch is
severe, and perhaps a little risky for the leader, but
the remaining four are easy, and the method of tackling
them obvious. This species of gully is suitable
for those who tire quickly, or whose impressions of
the work before them depend on the height they have
attained. On the other hand, there are climbers who
like to feel that there is always something serious
looming ahead, who want the troubles to last them
all through their climb, and rejoice in a <i>bonne bouche</i>
at the most elevated situation. Such lingering sweetness
they can find in the Central Chimney, but not
here; it is not surprising that many men are satisfied
with one visit to the Great Gully, and never make
for it a second time.</p>

<p>It takes us ten minutes to walk up from the lake
to the entrance of the gully. Then a few yards of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
scree and broken rock lead into a cavern, below a
chock-stone that offers much resistance to the direct
passage up the pitch. A massive buttress encroaches
on the left, and renders the gully almost narrow
enough for both sides to be employed together; but
close inspection shows that near the top of the pitch
the walls are too far apart and the handholds too
few. The climber does well to descend a few feet
and prospect the buttress itself. This exhibits a safer
route (see view on page 225). Close against the side of
the vertical left wall the buttress shows a slight fissure,
that starts from an easy grass platform and runs steeply
up to a level some twelve feet higher than the top of
the chock-stone. The difficulty lies in working up the
corner, following the crack as much as possible, and
taking sufficient care that the body does not swing
away from the footholds. A stout individual is likely
to feel handicapped at an awkward little ledge half-way
up from the grass platform. The fissure can be
followed straight up into the gully, but it is easier
to contour round the buttress and on to the top of
the true pitch. There is excellent belaying for an
ascending party, the rope lying along the crack and
gripping well at several points. It grips just too
well for the safe belaying of the last man in a
descent; he had better adopt the dangling method
and work straight over the chock-stone. This latter
direct route over the obstacle was tried once or twice
before 1889, but without success. It was left to the
brothers Hopkinson to show in that year that it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
offered a perfectly safe variation, though probably
most climbers will agree that it needs more muscle
than is wanted for the crack route. They clambered
into the cave and thrust a rope through the small
aperture in the roof. When a sufficient quantity had
been poked up in that way, it fell over the front of
the cave and was available for climbing. But it is
very severe work to swarm up a thin rope; in this
case there is slight assistance from the sides of the
gully, and the transfer of hold from the rope to the
rock comes when the arms are tired.</p>

<p class="small">(<i>Face page 225</i>)</p></div>

<p>After this difficulty is passed, some yards of scree
lead to the second pitch. The gully is narrow, and
the block is produced by two boulders one above the
other. There is no trouble in working through the
cave and on to the lower block, whence an easy pull
over the upper stone takes us again to a long line
of scree of the impulsive variety. This part of the
gully is pleasant only when snow is about, when
the ankle-twisting propensities of the scree are not
permitted full play.</p>

<p>We are near the point where the gully opens out
considerably, sending a branch up on the right.
But before that we have to mount two small pitches,
the first taken straight up, the second by either right
or left wall.</p>

<p>The branch exit on the right has no serious difficulties,
but it abounds in loose holds that the climber
may find hard to avoid. It leads on to the great
middle buttress of Doe Crag, above all its dangerous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
parts, and within easy access of the summit. The
direct ascent of the gully is interesting only at the
last step, where a narrow chimney must be passed.
Its right boundary is a long smooth slab, unusually
deficient in holds. There are three or four wedged
stones and the pitch is often wet, but by keeping
close into the chimney and working up the right
wall the trouble may be overcome. It is always
possible, of course, to descend a little and climb out
of the gully on the right.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Doe Crag Central Chimney.</span>&mdash;This climb
is known to very few people. Many are aware in a
vague manner that there is splendid climbing on the
great buttress of Doe Crag, but only one or two
cragsmen have learnt where to go for it. So far as
my own experience is concerned it was almost a
matter of accident that brought me soon after Easter,
1897, to the foot of the Central Chimney. The
previous day had been spent with Messrs. George
and Ashley Abraham on Lliwedd, in the Snowdon
district, and a tiresome cross-country night journey
to Coniston had not tended to put the keenest edge
on my hunger for adventure. My companion, Mr.
Godfrey Ellis, and I were really intent on ascending
by the ‘intermediate gully of terrific aspect,’ down
which Mr. Haskett Smith had climbed in 1888.
The Central Chimney certainly looked terrific, more
so than anything else we could find about there. It
was also reasonably intermediate, and we came to
the conclusion that our gully was found. Later
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
investigation showed that we had made a mistake,
for Haskett Smith’s chimney is at the north end of
the crags.</p>

<p>The Central Chimney attracted the attention of
Mr. Slingsby in 1887, but apparently ours was the
first ascent. Messrs. Broadrick have been up it
since, and I have been advised by one of their party
that the top of the chief difficulty is dangerously
loose.</p>

<p>We had heavy rücksacks to carry over to Wastdale
that day, and decided to leave them at the foot
of the climb, rather than suffer the inconvenience of
dragging them up with us. We had eighty feet of
rope, and needed it all near the top.</p>

<p>Our work started easily. Three obvious courses
led in about thirty feet to a broad, grassy platform,
from which the chimney made its proper beginning.
Each of the three ways involved scrambling; they
started a few feet to the left of the lowest part of
the crags, and formed between them a very fair
presentment of a gully entrance. But a glance
upwards showed that, for some distance at least, we
should have very little of the nature of a gully to
guide us. From the platform sprang up the vertical
wall that gives the central buttress its appearance of
inaccessibility, almost unrelieved for several hundred
feet. Our chimney commenced as a thin crack in the
wall from the platform, only large enough for a hand
to be thrust in, and so sharp-edged that one’s fingers
were badly cut in climbing the first five yards.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
Then the crack seemed to widen gradually until
from below it appeared sufficiently broad for
wedging. Appearances would have been comforting
but for the curious absence of retaining wall on the
right-hand side of the crack. The left was excellent;
on that side the rock stood out from the corner and
formed the finest part of the great buttress. But the
right wall was out clean away, leaving smooth slabs
that were sure to give trouble when we should find
the chimney too shallow for further progress.</p>

<p>I started up the thin crack, and found the strain
very severe on the arms. When it became wide
enough to support a knee it was possible to halt and
prospect a little. The next ten feet up the crack
were obviously most difficult, and a glance at the
north side showed that it would have been easier to
work up the right wall for twenty feet from the
platform before traversing into the crack again.
Ellis suggested that he should come up to my level
by means of a slight fissure in the right wall, and
steadied by the rope that I had flung over a small
projection some six feet above his head, he managed
to reach a shaky, sloping ledge of grass, and then to
manœuvre the rope for my own passage to the same
resting-place. We next worked upwards into the
chimney, and kept close in it for twenty feet or
so. There were good holds on the right until some
small boulders and <i>débris</i> formed a little platform,
over the edge of which we were able to pull ourselves.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p>The scenery about here was particularly impressive.
Our resting-place was scarcely big enough for
both, and a glance vertically downwards showed us
the spot where we had commenced operations three
quarters of an hour previously. The black depths
of Goat’s Water formed a striking foreground to the
view of Coniston Old Man across the valley, and it
almost seemed as though the tarn could be reached
by a stone falling from our tiny ledge. Up above
us the crags loomed fearfully. They overhung
considerably in places, and we saw that our only
course was to follow boldly the line of our chimney
till it abruptly terminated in the face. Fortunately
the weather was good, the rocks dry and warm. To
have attempted the chimney with much ice or water
about would have been foolhardiness worthy of our
wildest days.</p>

<p>From the ledge we found the climbing splendid,
keeping up the slight rib of rock on the right that
formed the nearly vertical boundary of the chimney.
The holds were just sufficiently large to give ample
support, especially when the back could rest on the
opposite side of the crack. ‘Backing up’ is usually
a very constricted performance, with but limited
views of the scenery around. Here on Doe Crag it
seems as though most of the mountain is cut away
excepting those parts of obvious utility to the climber.
We crawled round the rib when the crack became
too thin, and worked up several feet of slabby rock
until the appearances seemed to indicate that an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
actual gully was now about to manifest itself and
commence a fresh run up the wall. We therefore
traversed again to the left into a large recess, and
after a little scrambling upwards found ourselves
brought to a stop by a dead wall. The bed of our
recess was loose and steeply sloping. Its sides were
slightly iced, and considerable care was needed in
settling securely down to consider the situation.</p>

<p>The wall was about twenty feet high and too
smooth to climb. On each side of us were huge
overhanging buttresses that projected considerably
beyond the latter portion of our route. It was not
manifest which of these would offer the best way of
surmounting the wall, and it might be that neither
was suitable. We could see that a traverse out of
the difficulty might be made in the northern direction,
but it was very exposed and it led too far away
from our chimney.</p>

<p>Ellis braced himself firmly at the highest corner
of the recess, and manipulated the rope with special
care. I started working up between the two buttresses
in a manner that recalled to us both the well-known
picture of the Funffingerspitze chimney in
Sanger-Davies’ book. When some twelve feet above
him, it seemed safe to quit the left-hand side altogether,
and a stride effected the change of style.
But the return was now almost impossible, and in
the anxious five minutes that followed I had time to
repent the sudden resolve. The top of the wall was
within reach, but it was fringed with loose grass
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
tufts that scarcely seemed secure enough to offer
purchase in the upward heave that I wanted to give
myself. However, the time spent in hesitation was
sheer waste, for at the end the pull-up was perfectly
safe and easy, and a little wriggling over rock and
steep grass brought me to a long terrace, that
naturally suggested a halt for the second man’s
advance. In good time his head appeared above the
grass tufts that formed the limit of my foreground,
and a few seconds later he was sitting at my side
and speculating as to the length of the difficult piece.
The whole climb so far had been veritably one single
pitch; we had had no interval of comparative ease,
and were now eager to find some temporary freedom.</p>

<p>That we found in perambulating our terrace. It
was about a yard wide and fifty feet long, and gave
evidence that our gully as such had practically terminated.
We found it rather awkward clambering
up the wall some thirty feet to another similar
terrace. This stretched horizontally from the large
ravine that now disclosed itself on our right, and
across the face of the mountain towards the Great
Gully. The former, we could see, involved some
pretty climbing a hundred feet below us. At our
level it was merely a scree-walk finishing at the
highest part of Doe Crag.</p>

<p>Our route lay up the rocks above the terrace.
Two narrow clefts offered choice. We took the one
to the right, about fifteen feet long and sufficiently
tough to make us remember the place. Then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
followed easy hand-and-foot work till we could distinguish
the branch exit of the Great Gully. Down
this we carefully picked our way, and then returned
to gather up our belongings and make tracks for
distant Wastdale. The round had taken three
hours.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Intermediate Gully.</span>&mdash;We had a glorious
afternoon for this climb. The previous night had
brought us from town to Coniston, and we meant to
give ourselves an easy day. But fearing that the
weather might change we were tempted to seize the
opportunity and start earnest business at once.
Identifying the gully as the first to the right of the
longest buttress of the crags, we entered it and began
scrambling immediately. After five minutes of
‘staircase’ work, using both sides of the gully, we
came to a point where the left wall overhung a little
and the gully closed in. A flank movement was
then effected on the right, over steep rocks and unreliable
grass ledges, returning by a narrow traverse
into the gully at a point forty feet higher. The
second man came straight up, finding two pitches
confronting him, both of which he thought we could
have taken directly if time had allowed us to risk an
attempt. We kept in the ghyll for the next two
pitches, both of them fairly simple. A fine flat stone
at the top of the second offered a good standpoint
for the inspection of the overhanging wall that now
faced us. The gully had shrunk again into the
merest crack in the wall. My friend called it the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
extreme pitch of refinement. On our left a smooth
right-angled corner that probably thought itself a
branch gully led up to the ridge separating us from
the Central Chimney. Again it seemed desirable to
take to the right by a course that was at any rate
feasible, although it took us away from our direct
line of ascent. After fifteen feet of traverse the
buttress looked accessible, but recollecting the poor
holds that we had encountered in a corresponding
situation lower down, we went further away still,
descending slightly to a level platform where the
leader could be belayed during his direct ascent of
the wall. Fortunately the rocks were quite dry, as
otherwise the work that followed would have been
risky. At first the handholds were unsafe, but in
ten feet our industrious cleaning away of the grass
and earth disclosed an excellent cleft in the wall, safe
and sound. Thence the way was pleasanter, swinging
upwards towards the left again by immovable
rockholds. We had several yards of a narrow ledge
tilted upwards at 30° before entering our gully again,
and arrived in it just below a little pitch of the type
that tries the elbow.</p>

<p>Great caution was now needed. Not that the
climbing was difficult or dangerous, but the gully
had dwindled into little more than a slight indentation
in a vertical wall, and each man had to move
with the utmost deliberation. Holds were numerous,
generally better on the left wall, but they were all
rather wet. Soon we were engaged in a violent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
struggle with a small angular jammed block that
barred our way. It seemed loose at first, but we
proved its stability that afternoon by many minutes’
hauling and wrenching from below and above. The
chief difficulty was to get the shoulders firmly fixed
between the sides of the cleft above the jammed
stone; with only the block to hold and no rest for
the feet this manœuvre was very awkward to
perform. Above this a few steps led to a narrow
cave, which we climbed by its right edge and found
to be a trying piece of arm work. Here the gully
expanded into a large scree-bedded ravine with only
two moderately easy obstacles between us and the
top of the crag. To our left we could see the ledge
that marks the end of the Central Chimney. Our
own gully, looking backwards, seemed to be a
vertical plunge straight down to the bottom, and as
usual we caught ourselves wondering whether
anything else could be called difficult after this.</p>

<p>We reached the summit in two hours from the
start, and then skirting the lower edge of the crags
from Goat’s Hause, we made note of each gully as
we passed its foot. An easy scree shoot, followed
by a buttress set back at a gentle angle, but with
splendid practice on it; the North Gully with its
awe-inspiring middle pitch like the great obstacle in
Moss Ghyll; a branch gully leading into the North
Gully; a second branch, looking rather interesting
but lacking definition higher up; the Easter Gully
with its double centre portion; the Intermediate
Gully; the Central Chimney; and the Great Gully.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>

<p><span class="large2">The Easter Gully.</span>&mdash;The same party came
two days later to examine this climb. The weather
was very unsettled, and we were forced to the conclusion
that the main central chimney was too wet
to be approachable. The scrambling was easy up to
the cave; then we worked up the vertical left wall
by diminutive ledges till the level of the cave stone
was ours, whereupon an awkward bit of traverse
brought us safely out of the difficulty. We were in
the great hollow, and were astonished to find that
in addition to the main chimneys on the right and
left centre, there were splendid branch gullies up to
the ridges on either side.</p>

<p>I started up the left central chimney. It was
dry, but its holds were fragile. In forty feet it
divided into two parallel branches; that on the left
was overhanging, and held a bunch of long splinters
of rock forming a dangerous <i>chevaux-de-frise</i>, ready
to fall at the slightest notice. So we left it alone,
and looked to the right branch. For twenty feet it
went very well, and there, where one man might
safely wedge himself, it became practically impossible
to mount any higher. My companion, therefore, came
up while I worked out on the open face to the right.
Without much trouble a small platform one foot
square was reached, from which we proposed to mount
the buttress that separated us from the right central
chimney. I hesitated a long while before venturing on
it; the place was assuredly difficult, we were not
certain whether the upper portion would be feasible,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
and the strong wind, swirling mist, and intermittent
rain sapped our courage and strength the more we
deliberated.</p>

<p>The stiff work began with a scramble up into a
grassy corner, fifteen feet above my platform. It
was too small to enter, but from it sprang a narrow
cleft to the right, very much like the well-known
‘stomach traverse’ on the Pillar Rock, but considerably
harder to pass, and without an easy walk
out at the further end. At its highest point the
best course seemed to be up a vertical crack in the
wall, and a stiff scramble here of ten feet brought
me out on the head of the buttress. Here there was
a chance of walking over to the right central chimney
and finishing by the thirty feet or so that remained
of its special difficulty. But that portion was naturally
as wet as the lower part that we had purposely
avoided, and we chose to cross the chimney and
climb up its right wall.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="large"><i>COMBE GHYLL</i></span></h2>

<p>Many a pedestrian walking down Borrowdale
from the Styhead pass, looking backward at the
fearful descent of some 1,100 feet of rough fellside,
reaches a point in the valley where he experiences
difficulty in recalling his track. For the valley
between Gable and Seathwaite Fell is hidden, and
his choice hovers between the combe below Sprinkling
Tarn, walled in by Seathwaite Fell and Glaramara,
and the upland valley that nestles between
Thornythwaite and Rosthwaite Fells. His perplexity
is increased when he notices that neither hollow
satisfies the condition of background. The one is
barred by the crags of Great End, the other by the
steep wall of Raven Crag, a high dependence of
Glaramara; whereas the Styhead pass as seen from
Grange ought to show distant Scawfell as a background,
and be easily recognised. One of these two
hollows the climber will do well to identify.</p>

<p>Combe Ghyll is the name of the course that
drains the north side of Glaramara, the stream
making its way down the little valley that has
already been described as lying between Thornythwaite
and Rosthwaite Fells. At about the 1,000-feet
level in the valley the land is flat and marshy;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
with little provocation the stream could produce a
respectable lake, and the tourist in wet weather
feels that such absence of deception would be to his
advantage. Above this level the mountain rises
abruptly, and the ghyll has to acknowledge two
sources. That which sends its supply straight
down the centre of Raven Crag was the first to be
regarded as Combe Ghyll. But the other is longer
and more obvious. Looking up from the marsh the
watercourse is very distinct away to the left, though
the climb is equally in evidence on the right. When
a short time since three curious cragsmen (including
the curious writer) penetrated to the recesses of this
almost unknown country to find the climb that
Messrs. Robinson and Wilson had discovered and
christened as long ago as September, 1893, we were
compelled by that name to tackle the east branch,
but vowed at the same time to go later to the west.
Our conscientiousness was praiseworthy, though
mistaken, but as events developed themselves our
mistake had happy consequences. We managed
both ghylls, and were probably instrumental in preventing
a nasty accident to a couple of would-be
mountaineers whom we discovered in difficulties.</p>

<p>It was on a hot day in April. We had been disporting
ourselves for photographic purposes in the
Kern Knotts crack, and had sauntered down to Seatoller
for some soda and milk to give grace to our
jam sandwiches. Then we walked down the Rosthwaite
Road as far as the bridge over the Derwent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
and went across the opposite shoulder into the combe.
It was very close down in Borrowdale, and we were
glad to get out of the well of warm air and follow the
water for a mile or so to the marshy upland. Here
the walking was soft and pleasant. Water in our
boots was no hardship, and we even hoped that there
would be many waterfalls in our gully. Then came
the dilemma and our decision to keep to the main
stream. But the aspect of the Raven Crag gully on
our right, as we skirted the boggy ground below us,
was magnificent. Pitch rose above pitch apparently
without any easy stretches, and the whole gully
seemed to form just one vertical chimney in the
rocks, five hundred feet high. Moss Ghyll itself is
not grander than the Raven Crag gully as it appeared
that afternoon to our longing gaze, and even now that
the details of the latter climb are impressed vividly
in my mind I can assure myself that it was one of the
finest I have ever undertaken in Cumberland.</p>

<p>We followed our watercourse right up to its
beginning close to a little pass over towards Langstrath.
In general appearance it somewhat resembled
Piers Ghyll, with its slight gradient and short pitches,
its rotten walls and unavoidable water. But in respect
to the last consideration we were almost exempted
from a wetting, for the ghyll was nearly dry, and only
in the direct ascent of one pitch did we run any risk
of a drenching. No doubt the normal state of the
gully is very much worse than we found it.</p>

<p>With hazy impression of a hundred-feet pitch we
came provided with two eighty-feet lengths of rope, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
managed our climb with one only. The first pitch was
about fifteen feet high; the left wall was feasible, the
direct climb involved the passage through a dripping
cave and out by a hole in the roof, and the right
side of the gully was of steep grass and insecure rock.
We took to the latter, and with care managed the
ascent without dislodging much that might help
later climbers. Above this we had a view of a
waterfall about fifty or sixty yards further up, and
inasmuch as the rocks showed signs of nailed boots
we were for some time prevailed upon to believe that
we had really found our quest.</p>

<p>The bed of the stream was rough but easy for a
while. Two small pitches about six feet high scarcely
gave us pause before we reached the foot of
the waterfall that we had seen from the first
pitch. It was about twelve yards high; the walls
were four or five feet apart, and glistening with
the wet. They did not appear to offer very excellent
holds, but I found it possible to face the fall
and utilize as footholds sundry diminutive ledges on
either side. It was a case of spanning the gully and
walking up. About twenty feet from the bottom the
holds on the left wall were somewhat greasy, but a
yard higher the ledges on the right had so much
improved that it was a safe venture to pull over
to that side and effect a traverse to the top of the
double obstacle over which the water was falling.
While the others were rapidly following, we were
surprised to hear voices from above. I advanced a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
little, and discovered two young men perched precariously
on the face of the steep wall to the right.
Almost at the same moment a large stone fell from
their feet towards us, and, in an ecstasy of fear lest
they should bombard our last man, who was yet in
difficulties bestriding the gully below, we shouted to
them to stay still a bit and wait for us to advance to
a place of safety. Then with all speed we clambered
up to them, and let them down on the rope into the
gully again. They were distinctly in peril; that side
of the ghyll was as treacherous, with its loose splinters
of rock and steep unreliable grass, as it could manage
to be without falling by its own weight. The top
was slightly overhanging, and could bear no extra
pulling. The men were inexperienced; one of them
had no nails in his boots; they had walking-sticks
tied tightly to their wrists with string, and when we
reached them they were tired out with the physical
and mental strain. We reflected on our wonderful
good fortune in choosing this gully, and thought with
some bitterness that this was the way that the noblest
of sports acquired its notoriety for great danger. It
transpired that they had scrambled down into the
gully at the side of the waterfall that we had just
climbed, and saw no means of getting out of the
hole excepting by this loose wall.</p>

<p>We were now at the foot of a small pitch about
twenty-five feet high. It was divided by a vertical
buttress, and the water was flowing down to the left.
The right-hand side seemed rather insecure, so I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
climbed some thirty feet up the wall of the gully
again, and the second man clambered up the right-hand
recess, confident in the support of the rope
if his foothold gave way. He then traversed easily
to the top of the pitch, and drew in my rope as I
descended to his level and followed him. We asked
the last man how were the passengers to be conveyed
up the pitch. He replied, with perhaps just a touch
of malice, that the direct passage through the water
was the shortest, quickest, and cheapest route to the
top, and we at the summit were of the same mind.
Then our tourists were tied separately to the rope, and
hauled up through the fall. It was very uncomfortable
for them, but we got as wet ourselves later on.
We hoped that their bedraggled condition would
prompt them to a speedy descent and a relinquishment,
for that day at least, of the joys of crag-climbing.
That pitch was the last in the gully of any magnitude,
and our friends were able to walk out easily on to the
open fell and so down to Borrowdale. We ourselves
gave one last look around for the hundred-feet fall
that was to finish Combe Ghyll, and then, finding it
not, we bore rapidly westwards across the mountain
in search of the genuine article.</p>

<p>As we skirted the foot of the crags we passed
two small gullies that rose steeply above us, and that
for a moment made us stop to consider their qualifications.
In twenty minutes from the top of Combe
Ghyll we came to the first deep and well marked
watercourse. It was our Raven Crag Gully, and when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
we peered up into its dark recesses we felt that good
sport was at last before us. We finished the remnants
of our lunch and drank a little water. It was
not a tempting beverage, for the rocks just above
were covered with objectionable vegetation, and the
supply was so much below the average that the pools
seemed almost stagnant. Also, I was haunted with
the recollection of a dead sheep that we had passed
in the other gully, lying on a ledge close to the
stream. Mountain water is not always free from
microbes, especially in those craggy regions where
sheep come to grief.</p>

<p>We started on the climb close by a little pool of
water at the foot of a short and greasy pitch. It could
have been taken direct, but we worked round the
buttress on the left and entered the gully a few feet
higher. Then, penetrating well into the recess, we
were at once confronted by the first big pitch. A
steep buttress divided the gully into two parts, the
left-hand recess being cut deeply into the mountain
and forming a long and narrow waterfall. This was
the true bed of the gully. To the right of the buttress
the recess was comparatively shallow, but its easier
inclination somewhat compensated for its exposed
position, and we found that the footholds were just
sufficient to render a rapid advance possible. About
forty feet up I craved the second man’s helping hand,
but while he was advancing to offer assistance an
easy way of swarming up the buttress commended
itself; I found a resting-place at the level of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
top of the pitch, eighty or ninety feet above the foot
of the fall, where the second man could join me before
I ventured on the traverse round to the bed of the
gully. The traverse reminded us of the steps over
the buttress from the Tennis Court ledge in Moss
Ghyll, and was no doubt a place to respect in wet or
icy weather. Our last man came up more directly,
keeping on the inner side of the buttress for the first
half of the climb and then working straight up the
pitch. Excepting for an awkward bit of some three
feet at the middle of the ascent, his route had
advantages over ours. The rocks throughout were
splendid, and their warmth and dryness made the
scrambling easy.</p>

<p>A yard or two further, over great boulders
bestrewn in the bed of the gully, and we were
brought up at the foot of the second great obstacle.
Here the two side walls approached to within a
distance of four feet of each other, and straight down
the centre from a height of seventy feet dripped the
weak promise of a second waterfall. Close to the
water it was impossible to ascend, but some ten feet
away from it suitable ledges on either side discovered
themselves. These enabled me to use both walls
in a directly vertical ascent for so long as they
were within four feet of each other. Then I pulled
over to a crack on the right and performed a safety
wriggle to more open ground above, whence it
was easy to clamber over the big boulders at the
top of the pitch. The second man was asked to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
prospect the route on the other side of the left wall,
and came up with the report that the traverse out
of the main gully was easy and that the rest of the
ascent, about eighty feet of solid rock, was just comfortable
hand-and-foot work all through. While the
third was adopting the same tactics which we afterwards
remembered had been employed by a previous
party from Keswick, I went on to inspect the next
obstacle. It certainly was the worst-looking pitch
in the whole ascent. A large cave was formed by
two massive boulders jammed between the narrow
walls seventy feet above our heads. The first-floor
of the cave was fifty feet up, and from its roof dripped
the inevitable water-supply to damp our daring
ardour. The walls of the gully were close together
and covered with wet moss. Holds were very scarce,
and for a moment we considered the advisability of
working out on the right as others had done
before us, and traversing into the gully above the
cave. But a tentative backing-up in the main
chimney gave some hope of success in the direct
attack; and abandoning all idea of making a final
exit with dry garments, I cautiously worked up the
inner face of a leaf of rock on the right wall, the
others steadying my feet on sundry infinitesimal
ledges so long as I was within reach, and then
supporting me with words of encouragement and
approval. When within six feet of the floor of the
cave it became necessary to wedge well into the
chimney, with back against the left and scanty hold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
opposite. Then a desperate wriggle gave me a lift
of about eighteen inches and the handholds improved
sufficiently for haulage. Leaving the left wall, I
could just thrust my knee in a corner under the fall,
and lever up to the opposite side. Next a few easy
ledges brought me into the cave, and I paused to
wring the moisture from my coat and cap before
inviting the others to follow on. By regarding their
manœuvres and subsequent criticism it impressed me
as likely that I might have saved myself some exertion,
and perhaps have better avoided the water, by
keeping up the edge of the leaf of rock instead
of attacking its inner face. But that course would
expose the leader to a greater risk of slipping at a
failing hold, and would demand more ingenious
tactics.</p>

<p>Our cave was large and airy; the water passed
into it at the back, so that we could easily stay at
the entrance and avoid the fall. High up above our
heads were a couple of apertures in the roof, probably
wide enough for our passage, but difficult to reach.
The right wall of the gully was well broken up, and
without ado we set ourselves at it and worked round
the edge of the nearer overhanging block as a step
to the other. Some thirty feet of my rope ran out
before the second man advanced from the bed of the
cave: not that the climbing refused to admit an
earlier start, but that he was busy wringing out his
clothes. I awaited his advance impatiently, for a
bend in the gully prevented my seeing the next pitch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
above us&mdash;the last in the climb. But when he was
firmly braced against the top boulder, hauling in
the rope of the last man, I advanced to the end of
my tether to steal an early glance at the pitch that
report had spoken of so respectfully. Robinson’s
account in the Wastdale book was succinct enough:
‘A return on to the floor of the ghyll was made near
the top of the third pitch, when a little scrambling
led to a very fine waterfall more than 100 feet high.
Here climb in the water as little as you can; then
diverge slightly on to the right hand of the ghyll
just where the water spouts over a small recess; next
traverse across a rather difficult slab into the cave
under the final boulder, which is climbed on the left
hand and is the last difficulty.’ The only part of his
prescription that I had carried in my mind was the
‘climb in the water as little as you can,’ and we had
been applying it all day with varying success. The
trouble always is to make any headway at all against
a descending mass of cold water, and we had come
to regard the advice as indicative solely of the fact
that an available route was only to be found in dry
weather. To climb in the water as little as possible
meant to choose a dry season and to mount by the
usual line of flow. Another account that may prove
interesting was given me by Messrs. G. and A.
Abraham: ‘Some enjoyable scrambling in the bed
of the ghyll brought us quickly to the last obstacle
and certainly the finest part of the whole climb. The
climber is immediately reminded here of the great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
amphitheatre in the Screes Gully, for, although on a
much smaller scale, we have the same gigantic
buttresses and receding slabs, with three suggested
exits. The most obvious way out here is up the
waterfall as usual. This we attempted until the
amount of water on the steep, slippery rocks forced
us out on to the difficult right-hand wall, about
seventy feet above the beginning of the pitch. Here
we climbed straight upwards, and, traversing round
a very awkward corner, landed right on the top of
the pitch, the leader requiring considerable help for
the last twenty feet.’ Our own experiences were a
little different, a consequence of our fixed intention
to force a route directly upwards without any
traversing away on to the right wall of the gully.
Also, we were relieved of the necessity of avoiding
water, because it fell too diffusely to be avoided, and
so small an area was left to any of us that could be
affected seriously by further saturation. The first
part of the pitch was perfectly simple. We could
employ holds on either side and clamber up to a
platform made by an un-jammed stone with rounded
corners that had been caught in the cleft. It was safe
enough for our purposes, and two men could lodge
themselves conveniently above it. Straight up overhead
was a formidable chimney that looked feasible
in its upper portion but impossible to reach directly
from below. A long block of rock twenty feet high,
possibly part of the living mountain, prevented a
passage up the pitch to the immediate right of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
chimney; but between the smooth slabs of wet rock
that formed the right wall of the gully and this long
boulder a narrow crack wound its way up to
Robinson’s cave, and it occurred to all of us
simultaneously that the crack might be negotiated
and the awkward slab-traverse thereby avoided. But
the crack was as nothing to begin with, and from our
rickety platform we could obtain but scanty notion
of its safety higher up. I suggested advancing a
little to prospect, craving a shoulder to start from, and
a steadying hand for my completer confidence on the
doubtful little ledges that we were calling footholds.
The first ten feet went very well, but although
I found the crack useful for the left knee, it was
unable to accept the responsibility of my complete
stability. I sang out for another steadying hand,
and my most admirable second clambered on to the
shoulders of the last man without a moment’s
hesitation. They plastered themselves flat against
the slab, and I felt my right foot cease its uncanny
trembling as the outstretched hand held it firmly in
the niche it longed to use. This was downright
luxury, and in my sense of security there stole a
moment’s shame at the thought of so much dependence
on the others. But there! in climbing as in
football the combination is everything in the highest
developments of the game, and though success may
now and again be due to the unaided efforts of one
man, the full satisfaction that should follow victory
will only be felt by the whole party when all have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
contributed something to the manœuvring. Be it
remembered that in crag-climbing two heads are
better than one, even if the second head is only used
as a foothold. But there we were, three links in a
chain that reached from the platform to the widest
part of the crack that was to lead us to the cave.
The position was not to be dwelt upon, and I
hastened to relieve the others of their common
burden. In the crack and at arm’s length above me
was a well-secured angular stone round which the
rope could be passed. Using it as a hold I was able
to quit the precarious foothold on the right and
thrust the left knee well into the crack. The position
was one that could admit of no slip, the leg being
sufficient to hold the body well in; and before quitting
that favoured spot I untied the rope and slipped
the free end through the hole at the back of the
jammed stone before tying on again. The others
had descended by this time to the platform and were
taking in all the slack. Whatever the difficulty of
the few remaining moves to the cave, I was insured
against a big fall and could trust to the belaying of
the little angular block that had so neatly adjusted
itself to our needs. As a matter of fact the precaution
was scarcely necessary, though eminently
proper under the circumstances. The ledges above
me were good and firm, and with the rope gently
paid out from below I reached the cave without
more trouble.</p>

<p>The floor was sloping; but a comfortable and
reposeful attitude could be indulged in, well at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
back, far from the dripping eaves of the cave. But
I had committed an error of judgment with the rope,
threading the hole from above the jammed stone
instead of from below, before tying the bowline
round my waist. At the time the importance of that
consideration had not occurred to me, but now in my
ease, hauling up the slack between myself and the
second, I felt a sudden jerk. The rope was wrapped
completely round the jammed stone, whose angularity,
that had before commended itself to the hands,
now introduced so much friction that the rope would
no longer slip freely round it. We were perplexed
for a while, till our enterprising middleman, who had
many times before offered a key to our difficulties,
proposed climbing up as a leader, with the second
rope attached to his waist, and the fixed rope above
him used for steadying purposes whenever necessary.
We knew that the jammed stone that fixed the upper
rope could not be dislodged easily, and indeed I
was able to hold on to my end and oppose any dangerous
leverage. He climbed up with every confidence,
and reached the crack safely. Then, repeating my
movement with the left leg, he held on while disentangling
my rope, tying himself to its lower end as
soon as the complications were unravelled. A few
moments more gave me a companion in the cave, and
built, as it was, for two persons only, he mildly
suggested my withdrawal for the benefit of the
third man. Thence our method of advance was
practically identical with Robinson’s. We had a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
little walk of six feet over towards the left wall of
the gully, by ledges that lay on the very verge of a
sheer drop of eighty feet to the foot of the pitch.
Then the ascent was continued by a narrow crack
that commenced in a somewhat sensational manner,
not so much by reason of its difficulty as by the
feeling of nothingness to fall back upon in case of a
slip. The second was at my heels, and he was firmly
braced up by the sole remaining tenant of the cave.
Lifting the left leg as high up the crack as possible,
and accepting a push from behind, I reached over a
slab on the right and dragged up on to it. That was
to be the last big effort; the final pitch was all below,
and the gully eased away above me to its open finish.
I shouted the tidings to the others. With all eagerness
they followed, the last man claiming with pride
the discovery of a grand foothold that he had unearthed
or unmossed at the lower edge of the slab.</p>

<p>Well! we had had a rare little fight; the gully
had taken us an hour and twenty minutes of continuous
work, and we voted it a piece of solid good
business.</p>

<p>There remained the long walk back to Wastdale
and to dinner. I proposed getting there in an hour
and a half, and started on the journey with a pipe in
my mouth. We had about three miles of rough, high-level
skirting along the 2,000-feet contour to Sprinkling
Tarn, two miles of descent to the Burnthwaite
level, and a mile of valley walking at the finish.
The consequence was that very little smoking was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
enjoyed. We were a quarter of an hour behind time
at Burnthwaite, a laudable spurt in the valley being
abruptly terminated by the discovery of another
climbing-party on the track. We had found that if
two parties were late, dinner would await their
arrival; hence our motive for haste was removed and
we composed our gait and our thoughts for a more
sedate entry into the hotel yard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: In the first edition of this book, I followed
Mr. Haskett Smith’s nomenclature and located
the climb in Eagle Crag. It seems that this
shoulder of Glaramara goes by the name of Raven
Crag, and I have changed the name of the gully
accordingly. There are many Raven Crags and many
Eagle Crags in the district, but climbers need only
be warned against confusing the Raven Crag Gully
on Glaramara with the Raven Crag Chimney on
Great Gable.

<span class="large"><i>THE PILLAR ROCK</i></span></h2>

<p>Mosedale is closed in by Yewbarrow, Red Pike,
Pillar, Looking Stead, and Kirkfell. These form a
noble amphitheatre of dark mountains, a cordon
through which it is not easy to break. Between the
last two hills we can effect the passage of the Black Sail
over into Ennerdale, which passes down behind the
Pillar to the north-west. A more direct route to
Ennerdale is by Wind Yatt (or Windy Gap), a pass
2,400 feet high, between the Pillar and the Red Pike.
On the northern or Ennerdale side of the Pillar mountain
is the famous Rock, beloved of climbers great and
small. It springs up vertically from the steep fellside,
with a north face like a cathedral-front 500 feet high.
From the summit of the fell a descent of 400 feet of
steep rock and scree will bring us to the nearest part
of the crag. From the Liza River at the bottom of
the valley we have 1,100 feet of grass and scree to
tackle before reaching the lowest buttresses that
support the great wall.</p>

<p>From below, the precipice is seen to be divided into
two parts by a long, black chimney. This is Walker’s
Gully, named after the young man who fell there in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
1883. Its head is the point of convergence of sundry
lines of scree from the upper fell. It suggests a
funnel cut down along its centre-line, and scree
frequently slides down the sides of the funnel and
into the gully. This no doubt is the chief reason
why Walker’s Gully has never been climbed until
recently, when snow and frost diminished the risk
from this cause. It would prove difficult under any
conditions, and the risk of a battery of stones from
above is too heavy a handicap for the cautious
climber.</p>

<p>The Pillar Rock itself is on the right of the gully,
in our view from below. The crag on the left is
considerably lower, and in fact scarcely rises high
enough over the head of the gully to be visible from
above. But from the east it presents an imposing
appearance. Its outline partly suppresses that of
the higher crag beyond, partly combines with it,
audit is often mistaken for the actual Pillar Rock.
Hence the name Sham-rock by which it has been
known since 1882. It is a mere walk to reach the
summit from the Pillar Fell. The climbing on
the Shamrock is not quite so good as that on the
neighbouring crag, but it cannot well be neglected.
On the eastern side is the well-known Shamrock
Gully, a magnificent looking cleft in the rocks, finishing
with a huge <span class="large2">V</span>-shaped notch at the summit. A
natural arch spans the gully half-way up, and
an obstacle some few feet higher makes a pitch of
unusual severity&mdash;‘one of the stiffest pitches in all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
Cumberland.’ It was first climbed by Mr. Geoffrey
Hastings’ party in March, 1887, when a bank of
snow below the pitch gave a little help. In December,
1890, the climb was repeated by a party with the
same leader, without the aid of snow, and since that
date various ascents have been made with and without
snow. Among others a new route over the
obstacle was effected in December, 1896, by the
writer and three friends. It is probable that the
pitch turns back fifty per cent. of the people who
essay to climb it.</p>

<p>On the same eastern face, a few yards further
away to the north, is the Shamrock Chimney, a thin
crack running somewhat irregularly upwards to the
summit ridge. The credit of the first ascent belongs
to Mr. John Robinson, whose keen eye and sound
judgment made the ascent an accomplished fact, on
September 23, 1894, within a few days of his discovery
of the chimney. Shortly afterwards Robinson
showed me the route, and I was convinced at once
that in difficulty and extreme interest it was far
superior to the Shamrock Gully, and equal to the best
climbing on the Pillar Rock. The third ascent was
made by Dr. Lawrence in April, 1895. Not many
parties have been up it as yet, and I am hoping that
the full account of its details here supplied will
tempt others to attack it.</p>

<p>I have said that the Pillar Rock lies to the right
of Walker’s Gully when viewed from below. It is
bounded on the other or western side by a broad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
hollow in the fell, down which a slender stream flows
without any abrupt change of level till the foot of the
precipice is reached. There the ‘Great’ waterfall
disturbs the even tenor of its way, and is said to
offer a formidable obstruction to our approach of the
west face from below.</p>

<span class="author tcell">Keswick</span>
</p>

<p class="caption">THE EAST FACE OF THE PILLAR ROCK</p></div>

<p>From the Shamrock side we can get the best
idea of the shape of the Rock. We have first the
Pisgah rising out of the upper fellside, a pinnacle
easily accessible and only forty or fifty feet high.
Then to the right comes the actual Pillar Rock, the
‘High Man,’ separated from Pisgah by a narrow
vertical cleft, the ‘Jordan,’ that renders the ascent
from Pisgah almost an impossibility. At the Jordan
two gullies meet; one up the east side, short and
easy, the other up the west side, longer and more
difficult.</p>

<p>The outline of the rock is marked by a notch to
the right of the summit, where the Great Chimney
finishes, and a little further northwards it shows a
sudden drop to the level of the Low Man, the
immense buttress that from below hides the true
summit altogether. A cairn has been erected on the
top of this buttress, and the outline to the right of
this falls in one vertical drop of 400 feet to the
foot of the rock. This is the great north wall. It
is supported at the base by a minor buttress, the
‘Nose,’ that stretches across the full width of the
north wall, and along the top of which, immediately
below the precipice, an easy terrace takes us across
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
to the Great Waterfall from a point near the foot
of Walker’s Gully. From the eastern end of the
traverse rises the Savage Gully, a well-marked cleft
with sundry branches, reaching to the top of the
Low Man.</p>

<p>On the western side the rock appears much more
formidable. The chimney up to the Jordan looks
black, and its crest is overhanging. The wall of the
High Man itself is built up with long slabs of smooth
rock, broken only by the smallest grass ledges, and
its difficulties appear to increase near the summit.
This side of the Low Man looks as inaccessible as
the great north wall. Nevertheless a series of short
gullies starting from the foot of the High Man lead
obliquely up towards the left and offer a very easy
route to the southern end of the Low Man, whence
to the summit the climbing is but moderately
difficult.</p>

<p>The best ways of reaching the Pillar Rock are
given in full detail by Mr. Haskett Smith. It will
here be sufficient to remark that from Wastdale the
usual course followed is to ascend by the path
towards Black Sail Pass until about ten minutes
beyond Gatherstone Beck, then to make for the
ridge on the left leading over Looking Stead and up
to the summit of Pillar Fell. Thence a descent of
450 feet in a northerly direction brings us to the Pillar
Rock. Sometimes Mosedale is followed straight up,
and the steep slope climbed that leads to Windy
Gap. Thence the ridge to the right takes us in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
twenty minutes of easy going to the summit of the
Pillar Fell. Both these routes involve an unnecessary
ascent of 450 feet, and the ‘High-Level Route’ was
designed to avoid this waste of time and energy.
Looking Stead is reached as before from Gatherstone
Beck, and the wire fence followed up for a few
minutes as far as the head of Green Cove. Here a
cairn marks the spot where a rough path starts down
the cove. We descend only fifty feet or so, and then
turn round to the left and skirt along the north-east
side of the fell. It is unsafe to attempt the traverse
for the first time in a mist, but with clear weather
the various cairns that mark successive points on the
route can be easily discerned, and a half-hour’s walk
brings us to the wide scree gully running down by
the eastern side of the Shamrock. To reach the foot
of the Pillar Rock is a simple matter. The photograph
facing page 271 was taken across this scree,
and it will be seen that the route down to the
Nose is only a walk round the foot of the Shamrock.
A broad, sloping corridor in the lee of a
steep rock-wall further up the fellside, enables us
to steer clear of the Shamrock cliffs and to reach
their head without any hand-and-foot scrambling.
Thence across the scree descending to Walker’s
Gully we see Pisgah and the High Man, and with
care we can now make the traverse to the foot of
the Jordan Gully. There we are in a position
to start any of the ordinary short climbs on the
Pillar Rock. The west route can be reached by turning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
Pisgah on the left and descending the west scree
for 300 feet. The long climbs up the north face
are started from the Nose.</p>

<p>The Pillar Rock was first climbed by an Ennerdale
cooper named Atkinson, who in 1826 ascended by
the west side. The ‘slab-and-notch’ route on the
east side, starting from the upper screes above
Walker’s Gully, was devised by Messrs. Conybeare
and A. J. Butler in 1863, though it would seem that
the same side was successfully attacked a year or
two before. Matthew Barnes, a Keswick guide, found
a route across the eastern face to the Low Man, and
thence back along the summit ridge to the highest
point. He was climbing with Mr. Graves, of Manchester.
Mr. W. P. Haskett Smith found in 1882 a
direct way up to the High Man from the Jordan, and
a second route straight up the wall a few yards to
the east of the first. Two years later he reached the
summit by a particularly hazardous course still further
to the east, passing up close to the buttress whose
lower end marks the start of the ‘slab-and-notch’
route. In the same year he made the first ascent by the
Great Chimney on the east side. Mr. Haskett Smith
named the first three routes the ‘West Jordan,’ the
‘Central Jordan,’ and the ‘East Jordan’ climbs
respectively; the latter route is never undertaken,
and the other two are often termed the ‘Left
Pisgah’ and ‘Right Pisgah.’</p>

<p>For many years Mr. Haskett Smith made visits to
the north face, endeavouring to reach the summit of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
the Low Man from the easy ledge at its foot. On
the right his course was limited by the almost seamless
wall of rock that gives the Pillar Rock its appearance
of hopeless inaccessibility from Ennerdale.
On the left the Savage Gully cut off all chance of
traversing to the eastern side of the rock. The space
between was strictly limited, and it narrowed as he
climbed higher. Within thirty feet of an easy scree
gully that obviously led to the summit of the Low
Man, the only available course had dwindled down to
a slender rib of rock in a dangerously exposed
situation, much too risky to attack without guarantee
of its feasibility.</p>

<p>In 1891 this climber, with Messrs. Hastings and
Slingsby, succeeded at last in finding a way of descending
into the Savage Gully at that point. Their leader
then mounted its left wall and worked easily across
to the foot of the scree gully. The others followed,
and the ‘long climb’ up the Pillar Rock became an
accomplished fact. No published detailed description
of the route is known to the writer.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Shamrock Gully.</span>&mdash;This is rather an unpleasant
climb for those who dislike loose stones. The bed
of the gully is very steep and narrow. It is followed
straight up the centre, by using horizontal shelves on
either side that now and again flake off in a most
unexpected way. Extreme care is necessary on the
part of the leader, for his followers cannot avoid any
fragments that he may dislodge. The climbing is
otherwise easy, and very little distance should exist
between the separate members of the party.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>Half-way up the gully the bridge is passed, high
above our heads when no snow is about, but
occasionally completely blocked by heavy drifts.
Next the bed of the gully runs up into a little cave,
formed by the huge jammed stone that presents the
only genuine obstacle in the ascent.</p>

<p>The block is long and narrow. It leaves just
enough room on each side, between the walls of the
gully, for a thin chimney. That on the right is very
difficult to enter but comparatively easy to follow up.
The other is designed differently; it leads the climber
by a temptingly easy beginning into a position
twenty-five feet up, that will in many cases pound
him most distressingly, and his descent will be
uncommonly awkward. Hence it is that the right-hand
chimney was for nine years the only course
adopted.</p>

<p>The process of backing-up is, as a rule, safe,
though fatiguing. In the case of the Shamrock
pitch, the leader will never find his attitudinising
comfortable. If he starts from the shoulders of a
companion, he can at any rate enter the chimney;
but its walls are undercut, and he needs all his
strength to brace himself firmly between them. A
little higher and there is risk of jamming too well.
Twenty feet up he has to turn towards the block and
work up over a shelf on to the scree above the pitch.
It is not easy for his companions to follow on, even
with the aid of the rope.</p>

<p>The left-hand route was climbed in winter.
Sundry weak holds were frozen into position, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
the rounded top of the great block was glazed completely,
and the finish was of great difficulty. Dr.
Collier had told me that he thought the upper
portion just possible, and our party of December,
1896, decided to try it. I started up the first
twenty feet and then found the glaze of ice too
heavy for further advance. It was not very difficult
to traverse out of the chimney into a wider gully on
the left; but after rising a few feet in this, the great
smooth slabs in front completely barred the way,
and I attempted to return to the chimney. This
could not be effected, and hitching the rope over two
small excrescences on the wall I climbed down the
retaining ridge and rejoined my companions. This
was very unsatisfactory, though I was glad enough
to be in safety again. We had a long discussion
about the pitch, and referred to many engineering
principles. At last I suggested that the lightest
member of the party, weighing not more than nine
stones, should take the lead, and that I should follow
on closely as far as the difficult spot. There I proposed
to brace firmly in the chimney and thrust him
straight up to the frozen grass above. He looked
at me apologetically and said that he would go up
if I insisted on it, but would rather hear of some
different plan that deprived him of the honour of
leading. Then a bold but heavy man spoke up and
volunteered to take his place. It was my turn to
decline, and we felt completely at a loss. At last
I went up again to the turning-point of the previous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
venture, and for the sake of safety threaded my
rope through two or three jammed stones in the
chimney. Then followed the longest member close
behind me, likewise threading his rope. I climbed
on to his head&mdash;it had been tested many times
before&mdash;and then got him to steady my left foot on
a frozen hold half a yard higher. An ice-axe was
then passed up from the cave, and the pick rammed
hard into the frozen grass above the boulder. The
handle then offered enough stay to enable me to
pull up over the smooth icy surface of the boulder,
and the pitch was conquered. I cut steps up the
snow to a safe place for belaying the others, and
they then followed singly on a long rope. The rest
of the gully was simple walking.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Shamrock Chimney.</span>&mdash;This is shown very
clearly in the photograph facing page 271, as a series
of vertical pitches almost in a single straight line
from top to bottom of the Shamrock. We take to
the first set of easy rocks on the north side of the
great gully, and for about 160 feet climb over
irregularly disposed crags interspersed with grass.
These are usually wet and slippery, and they finish
at the extreme south end of the grassy terrace
crossing the Shamrock face.</p>

<p>We keep straight up and enter the lower extremity
of a narrow chimney thirty feet high. Its
two pitches are scarcely separated, and require careful
climbing up to the narrow cavern on the next
grassy ledge. The first real difficulty now lies in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
front. Ten feet of steep smooth rock are to be
climbed before we can enter the foot of the next
chimney, and the leader will do well to accept a
shoulder-up and a lift with an axe in tackling this
wall. It is practically impossible in icy weather.
The chimney is easy enough, with plenty of jammed
stones for a distance of twenty-five feet; but it then
dwindles down to nothing, and a very exposed bit of
work follows for the leader, who has to crawl up
some six or eight feet of rock without any respectable
holds. This brings him to another small cavern
just sufficiently large for him to take breath and
recover his strength. He cannot see his party below,
and in manipulating the rope for the second man he
will need to shout his directions. Then follow a
short traverse to the right, and an upward scramble
over more broken ground to an interesting splayed-out
chimney.</p>

<p>Thence a steep grass slope takes us up to an open
gully with a great overhanging boulder. It may be
passed straight over or by a through route, and we
are then at the end of the chimney climbing. A
turn to the right leads to a splendid ridge that runs
to the top of the Shamrock, and offers a finish as
charming as that of the Scawfell Pinnacle from the
Low Man. The work is over when a perched flat-topped
stone is mounted; and then we walk to the
summit of the Shamrock and down by easy ledges
to the screes above Walker’s Gully.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Pillar Rock, Jordan Climbs.</span>&mdash;Very easy
scrambling from the upper fell will bring the climber
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
to the summit of Pisgah. There is a short chimney
on the east side that leads to the same spot; it is
easy to enter, but the exit at the top is very stiff.
The view of the near wall of the High Man is interesting,
and there is ample opportunity for studying
the two direct climbs before descending to the gap.
They are both difficult, but the rocks are so much
scratched by nailed boots that the difficulty does
not consist in finding the way up. It is generally
supposed to be impossible to descend into the gap
from Pisgah, but inspection will show that there is
a series of small ledges a little to the west, down
which a safe passage can be effected. The Left
Pisgah route starts up at once from the <i>col</i>. The
holds are only moderately good for the first thirty
feet, and fail to give satisfaction when wet or icy.
Next it is possible to force the body into a narrow
crack, and for a little while the climber can cease his
strugglings and rest himself. Above this the rock is
more broken and the holds are better. A thin leaf
of rock is crossed and a downward view obtained of
the Right Pisgah final chimney. Then the slope is
eased off, and the cairn on the High Man is but a
couple of yards away.</p>

<p>The Right Pisgah route is generally started low
down the East Jordan Gully. This offers pleasant
hand-and-foot work, but no difficulty whatever up to
the Jordan. But before reaching the gap a square
recess on the right is entered, and then a passage is
made over smooth rocks to a clean-cut right-angled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
corner forty feet high on the south-east side of the
High Man. It is just possible to traverse round
from the Jordan to the top of the square recess, and
so up over the slabs to the corner, but the variation
is not worth much.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">“Round the Notch”&mdash;Pillar Rock. East Side</span></p>

<p class="small">(<i>Face page 267</i>)</p></div>

<p>The crack climb that now starts straight up the
corner is one of the neatest things on the Pillar
Rock. The right wall is used for steadying purposes
when, half-way up, a jammed stone makes it necessary
to emerge from the crack. Some of the holds
have splintered away during the last few years, but
there are yet enough to satisfy one’s needs. The
finish is a splendid pull up with the arms on to the
leaf of rock already referred to at the top of the
Left Pisgah climb.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Slab and Notch route.</span>&mdash;The upper part of
the Great Chimney offers no difficulty to the climber.
Its southern boundary is a long narrow buttress
called the ‘Curtain,’ stretching from the top of
Walker’s Gully, to the summit of the High Man.
Viewed in profile from the Pillar Fell, the Curtain
shows three distinct notches two-thirds of the way
up; they are about thirty feet above a slab set at an
angle of thirty degrees, and attainable by rough
scrambling from the foot of the East Jordan Gully.
The easy route passes along this slab, directly
upwards to the middle notch and thence round the
Curtain to the bed of the Great Chimney. The walk
along the slab is to some people a critical undertaking,
for a slip would have very serious consequences.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
A thin crack on the line of march makes the course
safer, unless ice or snow have filled it up, but it is
not an unusual sight to see men tackling the walk on
all-fours. The Curtain may be crossed at the lowest
notch, the ‘Ledge,’ by good firm rocks, and the Great
Chimney entered on the other side. Formerly it was
the usual course to reach the bed of the chimney
at the lower part of the steep grass by what was
called the ‘Eight-foot Drop.’ But there is no need to
drop at all; an easy traverse from either the Notch
or the Ledge brings the climber above the steep
grass, and virtually at the end of his cragwork. The
chimney finishes with scree, and lands the climber
within a few feet of the cairn on his left.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Variations on the East Face.</span>&mdash;It is possible
to make a way straight up the Great Chimney from
its foot, joining the easy route about a hundred feet
up. Haskett Smith took this course in 1884, commencing
the climb on the stepped buttresses of the
Curtain. Since then the rock has had time to loosen
a little, and climbers very rarely enter the chimney
that way.</p>

<p>The <i>Pendlebury traverse</i> is an excellent variation
of the ordinary route, a popular scramble first indicated
by Professor R. Pendlebury, of Cambridge.
From the slab the way lies straight up to the notch in
the Curtain, and then along a horizontal ledge in its
south face as far as the corner where it meets the
High Man. Thence up the corner is straightforward
chimney-work, and on emergence at the top the cairn
will be visible close at hand on the left.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

<p>The traverse looks difficult until it is closely
approached, when it will be found that handholds
abound on the wall, and that the ledge is perfectly
firm and continuous across the whole width of the
Curtain.</p>

<p>The chimney in the corner of the south side of
the Curtain can be entered much lower down. From
the slab a way lies straight up into it, but the grass
holds are not particularly pleasant if wet, and the
first thirty feet are severe.</p>

<p>From the head of Walker’s Gully a way may be
found to the Low Man, below the immense slabs that
crown the north-east buttresses. It is best to climb
the Shamrock first and prospect the route. Sheep
occasionally manage to get across, and the <i>Old Wall</i>
was built many years ago to prevent their passage, but
it is now ruined. Sometimes, ignoring Badminton,
they still venture across without a rope, and their
weaker members are liable to get crag-bound.
Climbers can tell many tales of famished sheep found
in appalling situations on the Pillar Rock. They are
too weak to resist the slipping on of a rope, and are
simply hauled or slung out of every difficulty till a
safe pasturage is reached.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The West Climb.</span>&mdash;This was the route first
discovered. It is much longer than any of the ways
on the south or east side, and possesses but few
interesting details. It is more popular as a descent
than as an ascent.</p>

<p>It is seemingly impossible to climb directly up the
west wall of the High Man, but in the walk down the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
west screes it will be noticed that the rocks of the
Low Man are more broken, and that several short
scree gullies sloping upwards to the left mark a
rough route straight towards the Low Man cairn.
The course is best examined from a distance, across
the great western gully; it lies as close to the High
Man as is possible without undertaking anything but
gully scrambling. Not infrequently climbers find
themselves astray on narrow grassy ledges too much
to the right. I experienced the same thing myself
when first attempting to find the way up, and found
the ascent by no means so easy as report had
credited the west climb.</p>

<p>From the level of the Low Man the way lies very
nearly along the sky-line to the highest point. The
High Man is struck at the end of a square corner
in the rock, and there is some excellent work for the
arms during the next thirty feet of ascent.</p>

<p>It is easier to turn over slightly to the east side,
and up by the great jagged boulders on the crest of
the ridge. The <i>Slingsby crack</i> is a short but rather
stiff variation a little on the right or western side of
this route and is particularly interesting. Formerly
a loose block at its upper end gave the climber an
occasional scare, but there is nothing unsafe now in
the form of detached boulders, and the ridge can be
followed with confidence to the High Man cairn.
Nail marks are strongly in evidence all through the
crag-work; the leader should not attempt the route
if snow or rain prevents their recognition, unless he
is already perfectly acquainted with the way.

<p class="caption">THE NORTH FACE OF THE PILLAR ROCK</p></div>

<p><span class="large2">The North Climb.</span>&mdash;For several months after
the first ascent it was difficult to learn anything of
the details of the route up the Ennerdale face of the
Pillar Rock. The only way was to persuade some one
who had been up to take the lead and act as guide;
for a complicated course that had taken Haskett
Smith eight or nine years to work out was not likely
to be mastered easily by any one who had not made
a special study of the north face.</p>

<p>My own chance came in the summer of 1893.
Mr. John Robinson called for me at Buttermere one
fine afternoon, and took me off to Ennerdale with
another friend, Mr. F. W. Hill. We left the village at
two o’clock, and were back again after a successful
ascent by eight in the evening; whence it may be
inferred that Buttermere is as good a starting-point
for the Pillar Rock as Wastdale or Seatoller.</p>

<p>Our guide led us rapidly by the shortest route
over Scarth Gap, and across Ennerdale to the foot
of the Pillar Rock. Then a fifty-feet length of rope
made its first appearance; it had been hidden in a
bag during our walk, lest we should alarm the folks
about Gatesgarth. We tied ourselves up, and made
for the eastern end of the terrace across the Nose.</p>

<p>Robinson then started along the terrace, and in
a few yards scrambled up to a shelf on the left, five or
six feet high, which gave us easy access to the lower
portion of the Savage Gully. This latter has never
been climbed along its whole length. If the gully
were moderately easy, the north climb would be far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
less complex. But for a great portion of its length
the side walls are at right angles to each other; the
corner is nearly vertical, and the only resting places
are diminutive, grass-grown ledges placed too far
apart for any safe employment of the rope. The right
wall of the gully forms part of a conspicuous buttress
on the north face, whose western side is much more
broken and less dangerous to ascend.</p>

<p>The route that was being shown us lay along the
Savage Gully for about sixty feet, then across to the
west side of the buttress and up a vertical branch
gully with sundry small chimneys in it. Higher up,
we were told, it would be necessary to round a cliff
still further to the right, by means of the <i>Stomach
traverse</i>, to render further ascent possible. We objected
to the inelegant name, but were too far advanced
to hesitate on the score of a faulty title. Above the
traverse our climbing would be easier, until the course
returned to the Savage Gully again. That was to
be our <i>mauvais pas</i>, and after settling it the scramble
to the Low Man, and thence to the highest cairn,
would be scarcely more than a walk.</p>

<p>So spoke our guide, and having delivered himself
at some length, with an occasional appropriate
anecdote thrown in, he concentrated his attention
on the small pitch that marked our point of arrival
at the Savage Gully. It was a wall seven feet
high with indifferent grassholds at the top, and in
scrambling up care was needed to avoid dislodging
loose stones near the edge. It was then easy to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
clamber into a small cave somewhat to the left, and
out again by a twisted tunnel at the back. Thence
Robinson worked upwards over broken ground for a
few yards, until the point was reached where we
were to leave the gully. The direct route looked
feasible for some distance ahead, but there was no
questioning the fact of its severity, and we had not
come out that day for exploration.</p>

<p>A divergence was made along an easy traverse
towards the right, to a short and narrow chimney
that already bore traces of many previous struggles.
Wherever the rocks were clean and free from scree,
we could plainly see the scratches of nailed boots
along the route. It was here that we were rounding
the great buttress of Savage Gully, and after a little
rough-ledge work we arrived at a square corner with
a grassy floor. Straight up from this floor a cleft
offered safe passage. It was plentifully supplied with
holds, though some discrimination was necessary in
selecting the firmest. The climbing was delightful,
and zest was given to it by the magnificent situation.
The corner was not so deeply impressed in the
buttress as to prevent our recognition of the vastness
of the cliff we were slowly ascending. The view
downwards just included the little grass platform,
and beyond that the wild and steep fellside at the
foot of the precipice, already some hundreds of feet
below us.</p>

<p>We kept up the direct route so long as we were
able. Then the cleft in the corner suddenly dwindled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
down into the thinnest of cracks, and it was obvious
that a change of tactics would be necessary. The
left wall was faultlessly smooth. The right for the
most part looked just as inaccessible. The grass
ledge on which we were standing really seemed to
suggest finality, the end of our upward progress, and
I turned to Robinson inquiringly with the impression
that some wonderful engineering process with the
rope was now to be explained to us. We knew that
such was necessary on the climb, and were prepared
by the situation to see its application immediately.</p>

<p>But the solution of the difficulty was of the
simplest character. A few feet from the corner the
smooth right wall was split by a single crack that
passed up at an angle of perhaps thirty degrees and
terminated at a notch that broke the clean-cut outline
of the rock facing us. From the notch it certainly
seemed as though nothing could be done further,
even if we got so far. Nevertheless, we were assured
that when once we were there all doubts would
vanish, and we should have the easiest hundred feet
of scrambling in the whole day’s expedition. The
crack was the famous <i>Stomach traverse</i>; it was
reached as long ago as 1884 by Haskett Smith in
his early exploration of the north face; and the
name, which had only recently been given to it, was
intended to show how the passage was supposed
to be tackled. One of Willink’s illustrations in
the Badminton, showing an intrepid cragsman
crawling along a ledge from left to right, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
sometimes criticised as an exaggeration of the
difficulties that rock-climbers have to overcome.
This traverse before us was not so easy as the one
so cleverly depicted by the artist. It sloped upwards,
and the ledge was not wide enough for the
whole body. We were in no sense precariously
placed, for the cleft enabled us to wedge with
security; but the right half of the body was outside
the leaf of rock on which we hung, and the
right leg found no support on the vertical wall.</p>

<p>Some twenty feet of wriggling brought us each in
turn to the critical corner, and there to our amazement
we had merely to get up and walk away. The
wall we had passed was the last obstacle separating
us from a long stretch of steep grass chimneys and
broken rocks. These extend from the Nose at the
foot of the crags up to the final difficulty, now only
a hundred feet above us, and offer the easier route
up the north face. Our own course by the Savage
Gully was by far the more entertaining one, and
under most conditions decidedly safer than the
other.</p>

<p>From the notch we could either walk straight up
to the cave-pitch in the corner now facing us, or
work easily round a rib of rock on the right and
join the other route. We chose the former, and
found the pitch decidedly stiff, the main trouble
being to get satisfaction out of the diminutive
hand-holds on the upper surface of the top boulder.
However, it was time to be thankful for small
mercies, and confidence carried us up safely.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<p>A party coming up the easy way would start from
the terrace on the Nose, close to its highest point.
Their route would be quite straightforward, though
occasionally the question as to the safest movement
might introduce a slight digression. The great wall
of the Low Man on their right limits in the most
definite manner all westerly climbing, and their only
trouble would be in negotiating two narrow chimneys
and some of the grass ledges, where the tufts are
unpleasantly loose and the slopes very slippery. The
fact is that this way is not much to be recommended;
until it joins the other there is little merit to justify
the variation. If parties are certain they can finish
the second half of the ascent, they can assuredly
climb the lower portion <i>via</i> the Savage Gully and
the Stomach traverse.</p>

<p>We halted for a moment above our cave-pitch and
looked around at the crags. From a distant survey,
such as that indicated in the photograph facing page
271, it is impossible to realize that so large an open
space of easy ground can exist on the north face.
But our opportunity for advance was strictly confined
to one direction. Further westwards we could not
go; the great wall was unassailable. To the east we
could have perhaps traversed away until progress
was barred by the narrow branch of the Savage
Gully, which we had utilized lower down. The
northerly direction of course led down the easy
route, and the southerly pointed to an uncompromising
extension of the great wall towards the
Savage Gully.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>

<p>We were led straight up the small scree to the
<i>split block</i>, a huge boulder at the foot of the wall.
The leader disappeared into a deep crack, and after
a few moments appeared at the top of the block,
having mounted by a secondary fissure that cut into
the left portion of the boulder. The movement was
quite unexpected, and Hill and I were rather startled
at the aspect of things from the summit of the split
block. It stood at the top of the narrow branch of
the Savage Gully already referred to, and the view
vertically down this branch was calculated to make
us hesitate before taking the next step.</p>

<p>This was the <i>Strid</i>. Close up against the wall
that blocked the head of the gully, a long stride was
to be taken across to a narrow ‘mantelshelf’ on the
other side. There was no difficulty in the step, but
the consequences of any slip were so obvious that
we were not surprised to learn how respectfully the
Strid is usually regarded. The mantelshelf led us
along under the wall for a few yards, and an upper
ledge was mounted. We were now close to the
Savage Gully again, and Robinson prepared to be
let down into it on the rope. We were adopting the
tactics of Haskett Smith’s party in the first ascent.
Robinson was to climb down the wall of the gully
by means of an irregular crack twenty-five feet long,
using the rope to steady himself during the descent.
At the foot of the crack he would be able to step
into the bed of the gully, and thence, after mounting
it for a few feet, effect an easy passage up the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
opposite side. He was then to unrope, and Hill was
to let me down in the same way, there being plenty
of friction between the rope and the rocks to enable
him to hold my weight in case of a slip. When
safely landed in the gully, I was to take the rope up
to Robinson and wait the issue of events.</p>

<p>These went off without a hitch. The crack was
difficult, though not impossible for one man to
descend alone; but I am convinced that a man
attempting the climb single-handed would be
running great risk if he proceeded without some
sort of belaying with a rope. The little story is well
known of the youth who could not understand why
he as third and last man of his party had to be left
behind on the ledge; he had examined the crack
and was certain he could climb down safely without
support from above. Nay more, he insisted on
demonstrating the fact, and when three-quarters of
the way to the bed of the gully his feet slipped and
his handholds failed. Luckily the others were able
to prevent a serious fall, and the young man’s ‘climbing
down’ was strictly metaphorical.</p>

<p>Robinson then rapidly swarmed up to the left of
the gully, and, after mounting forty feet, traversed to
the right into a long scree-shoot that ended abruptly
some twenty-five feet vertically above our solitary
companion on the ledge. Upwards the scree led
straight to the summit level of the Low Man, and
two of us were of course in a position to attain this
point in a couple of minutes. But there was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
third, to manipulate, and Robinson proceeded to take
out a short, spare rope from his sack and expound
the method of using the ‘stirrup.’</p>

<p>He tied a loop on to one end of his spare rope,
large enough for a foot to be comfortably slipped
therein, and flung that end down to Hill. I operated
with the other rope, sending an end down for Hill to
tie round his waist in the usual manner. The object
of the process was to get the third man up with the
least expenditure of energy on our part; in fact, to
make Hill do all his own lifting. The wall was not
so complicated in design as to render it impossible
to haul him straight up like a bale of goods. But
neither he nor I had till then seen an application
of the stirrup-rope, and we had come out to be
educated. There are many places where the method
is well worth employing.</p>

<p>The operations commenced by Hill’s fixing a foot
in the stirrup and lifting it a couple of feet as
Robinson hauled up his rope. Then, with Robinson
simply holding on firmly, Hill straightened himself
on the stirrup, using it as a foothold, while I
pulled up the couple of feet of slack in the waist-rope.
Next it was my turn to hold hard as Hill
raised his stirrup foot, and then Robinson’s to keep
the foot firm while Hill lifted himself on to it. These
two moves were repeated again and again alternately.
All through the process the ropes were held as free
from slack as possible, any upward movement of
Hill’s engaged foot or body being responded to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
promptly by Robinson or myself respectively. It
will be perceived, if the description is as clear as I
want it to be, that all the actual lifting of Hill’s
weight he managed himself during the straightening-out
on the stirrup, and that we others were at most
called upon to hold only his weight. Even this
much stress on our hands we could avoid by partial
belaying, though in that particular spot there were
no entirely suitable projecting rocks that could be
utilized as belaying-pins.</p>

<p>Bit by bit Hill worked up the wall, till at last his
head and shoulders appeared over the rounded coping
at our feet, and he scrambled on to the scree. Then
we all sat down and Robinson told us tales about that
particular locality. Among others he gave us one to
emphasize the practical lesson we had just been having
on the use of the stirrup-rope. A famous climber,
indeed he was sometime president of the Alpine
Club, and in a vague, traditional sort of way years
before he had fallen some hundreds of feet down a
vertical gully hard by, without coming to any harm
except that of finding his name ever afterwards
associated with the gully; well, this famous climber
was coming up that same wall by means of the
stirrup-rope, and the zealous operatives above more
than responded to his slightest movements. He
lifted his foot a few inches, they hauled up the
stirrup-rope a few yards, and anticipating that he
might find the alternations a little laborious, proceeded
to pull him up by sheer strength of goodwill.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
Thus his attached foot appeared first over the edge,
and the remainder of his person followed in some
confusion. So, at any rate, the story went.</p>

<p>Sitting as we were with our faces towards Buttermere,
the great wall bore away to the left, and our
scree gully marked its eastern limit. A horizontal
crack extended for several feet across the wall,
starting from the top of the pitch below us. Only
its end could be seen, but by carefully working
down to the corner on the left, and looking across
the face, we could see the way it cut clean into the
rock. This was the notorious <i>hand-traverse</i>, by
which it was just possible to reach our scree gully
from the ledge below without the preliminary descent
into the Savage Gully.</p>

<p>A few minutes’ halt and we continued our course.
There was no doubt or difficulty in reaching the
Low Man, and thence following the ridge to the
junction with the West Climb. A quarter of an
hour saw us at the High Man cairn, and another
five minutes at the foot of the Central Jordan. The
ropes were stowed away again in the sack, and
Robinson rapidly strode across the screes and down
the corridor behind the Shamrock. In a phenomenally
short time we were crossing the Liza stream,
and, without being allowed to halt, a bee-line was
drawn for us over to Scarth Gap by our untiring
leader. Luckily for his followers, the name of this
pass, which is sometimes called Scarf Gap, reminded
him of a very good story concerning another famous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
climber who went to an evening party without a
dress-tie. We were told the story and recovered
breath sufficiently to continue our journey to Buttermere.
I wish now that I had not been so fatigued,
so that I might have remembered the whole anecdote
and given it here in all detail.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Hand-Traverse.</span>&mdash;Nearly two years after
the ascent described in the previous section, Dr.
Collier showed me a way of avoiding the Savage
Gully in the North Climb by following a direct
route to the upper screes. The plan is to work to
the extreme east corner of the ledge that succeeds
the ‘mantelshelf,’ and when a narrow overhanging
chimney is reached, to swarm up the steep buttress
on its left. It looks particularly dangerous, but there
is an excellent hold for the hands just round the corner
of the buttress, and when the first three feet of ascent
are accomplished the rest feels comparatively easy.</p>

<p>On the same occasion we each in turn ventured
on the <i>hand-traverse</i> from above. The place has
already been referred to; it was known for some
time that the crack could be reached from the
terrace below, and Mr. Solly showed in 1891 that it
could be followed to its left-hand extremity at the
scree gully. It is so named because the climber
hangs by his hands, with no footholds at all for the
greater part of its length, and traverses across the
face by sheer strength of his arms. Collier and I
were well satisfied concerning the security of the
crack itself. We went to the further end and back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
again, without coming across any place where the
holds were treacherous. They were probably more
satisfying to the grip than an ordinary horizontal
bar, on account of the acute edge of the rock.
On the other hand, we had no opportunity of trying
the ascent from the terrace, which promised to be
rather fatiguing for the arms, and which might
render them useless for the traverse itself.</p>

<p>On Whit Monday, 1896, a chance came for
tackling the pitch in this new way. It had been
successfully accomplished once, and twice had the
climber’s strength of grip failed him when half-way
across. So, at any rate, we learnt by hearsay at
Wastdale. Perhaps it ought to be added that in
one case it was the leader of the party who fell off,
and the rope saved him in a manner scarcely short
of miraculous; in the other case the rope was held
from the scree gully, and the climber only swung
out on it. Our Whitsuntide party were willing that
I should try, and carefully measured out just a
sufficiency of rope for me to reach the crack. Then
two of them stood together at the western extremity
of the terrace, and shouldered me up the first bad
bit. There was every reason to be quick, as resting-places
were absent where the strain on the arms
could be eased. In twenty-five feet I reached the
crack and halted for a moment on a scanty foothold
before trusting to the ledge. Then came the swing
off and a hasty sliding of the hands along the sharp
edge. The first bit was about eight feet long; then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
that particular crack terminated abruptly in the
wall, and another, two feet higher, continued across
in the same easterly direction. The lift of the body
up to the second crack was trying, but beyond this
critical point the movement was horizontal. It was
somewhat clumsy&mdash;the scraping of the body along
the rough surface of the rock, with the legs held
clear; but my sole thought was to reach the end of
the traverse twelve feet away, and no consideration
of style was entertained. In a very short time,
though it seemed far too long, the end of the wall
was attained, and it only remained to drag myself
up to the scree.</p>

<p>The rest of the party preferred to mount the
buttress by Collier’s route indicated in a previous
paragraph. I think the hand-traverse has not been
attempted since, and it is perhaps just as well. It
is scarcely less than suicidal to try conclusions with
this variation unless the climber has full confidence
in his strength of grip, and unless he has already
tested his powers of endurance of long-continued
strain in the arms. But with the leader of the party
already at the head of the pitch, no matter which
way he got there, it involves no serious risk for the
others to follow by this route. The last on the rope
had better come up over the buttress.

<span class="large"><i>NOTES ON REMAINING CLIMBS</i></span></h2>

<p>In this chapter it is proposed to deal summarily
with a few remaining rock-climbs that have not yet
been described. Some are rather awkward to reach,
others are perhaps too slight to be worth the time
spent in reaching them unless they actually turn up
in the day’s march. One or two I have not visited,
and am reluctant to accept the responsibility of
guiding people up them. But</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What he thought he might require,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He went and took&mdash;the same as me!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is too general a motto among book-writers for me
to hesitate long before incorporating other people’s
notes, and the attempt will be made to acknowledge
the source in each case.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Piers Ghyll.</span>&mdash;This is a fine-looking ravine on
the north side of Lingmell, occasionally visited by
climbers. It has four or five comparatively easy
pitches before the big bend, but at the point where
the main gully is bridged by a great mass of rock
the whole width of the ravine is occupied by a waterfall
fifty feet high, and any attempt to force a passage
up this pitch is peculiarly unsatisfactory unless a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
rainless season has much diminished the volume of
water passing down. Such a season was that of 1893,
and in April of that year Dr. Collier led the first
party up the whole length of the ghyll. Even under
those favourable circumstances the climb was very
difficult, and no other party has succeeded in repeating
the ascent. Dr. Collier tells me that the hardest bit
is up the narrow pitch before reaching the great fall.
The latter offers a choice of two or three routes.</p>

<p>Piers Ghyll is conspicuous from a distance, and
many a tourist knows the place. Hence it has a
reputation of its own even as a climb, which it can
scarcely be said to deserve. If, as Haskett Smith
expresses it, it is in nineteen seasons out of twenty
wholly impossible to get over the great obstacle, it
cannot rightly be called a climb. The scrambling up
to the bend is mostly unpleasant by reason of the
water and the loose character of the rock. An exit
can there be made up the wall on the right, but the
friability of this wall makes its ascent positively
dangerous except at one spot where a scree gully
runs nearly to the top of the cliff.</p>

<p>A most interesting account of the ghyll, giving
certain of the adventures that explorers have encountered,
may be read in ‘All the Year Round’ of
November, 1884. It was contributed by Mr. C. N.
Williamson; other parts of this article dealing with
Cumberland climbing have already been referred to.</p>

<p><span class="large2">High Stile.</span>&mdash;The north side of this mountain is
precipitous, and two or three short but interesting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
gullies can be followed up to the ridge. Two of them
can easily be recognised from Buttermere village.
The central gully faces towards the north-west and
is to the right of the highest point on the mountain.
It has two well-defined pitches, the second being very
severe. The writer climbed it in 1893 with Mr.
John Robinson, before taking the chimney described
in the next paragraph, but seemingly it has rarely
been visited since.</p>

<p>To the left of the central gully a wide black
chimney can be seen, leading up close to the summit
of High Stile. It offers a short but very difficult
scramble; in pulling up over the edge of the great
pitch care must be taken to avoid the loose stones.
In the first ascent the leader had a bad encounter
with three boulders that slipped over on to his head.</p>

<p>A long, easy gully in the north-east shoulder of
the mountain offers a pleasant route down from the
summit to the shores of Buttermere.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Buckbarrow.</span>&mdash;The side of this hill facing
Wastwater has sundry attractions. Climbers who
are not pressed for time, on their way from Wastdale
to the nearest stations on the Furness Railway, can
be recommended to visit the crag.</p>

<p>The first main gully at the northern end was
climbed at Easter, 1892; two short parallel chimneys
terminate the ascent, that on the left being supposed
to be the harder. Besides this route, there are a few
ways of tackling the face further to the west; but
details are not at hand by reason of the rarity of the
visits to Buckbarrow.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<p><span class="large2">Sergeant Crag Chimney.</span>&mdash;This was first
ascended by Mr. John Robinson and the writer in
September, 1893. The crag itself is reached by
walking up Langstrath from the village of Rosthwaite
for about a mile and then bearing to the left. Close
to the stream, at the point where we leave the track,
is the Gash Rock, an isolated boulder that offers
considerable resistance to any one attempting to
climb it. It was climbed first by the writer in 1893.
A good hold has recently been cleared at the critical
point on the boulder. The scramble is said to be
quite easy now.</p>

<p>The gully in the crag is in sight half-a-mile below
the Gash Rock, and is well worth the visit of a
strong party. It was noticed in 1886 by Mr.
Haskett Smith, but seven years elapsed before the
first ascent was made. Curiously enough, the
second ascent was effected a day or two later by
Messrs. Phillimore and Anderson, in entire ignorance
that the gully had so recently been overcome.</p>

<p>Information embodied in the following notes of
the successive pitches has been supplied by the
brothers Abraham of Keswick, whose interesting
photograph of the great pitch in the middle of the
ascent is reproduced facing page 286.</p>

<p><i>First Pitch.</i>&mdash;Chock-stone about fifteen feet high,
passed to the left on the face of the rock. Good
hand and foot holds.</p>

<p><i>Second Pitch.</i>&mdash;Small chock-stone. Both hands
are reached up to the top of the stone and a straight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
pull over effected with the arms. The obstacle is
about nine feet high.</p>

<p><i>Third Pitch.</i>&mdash;Sundry boulders forming a block,
about fifteen feet high. The right-hand side of the
gully is ascended until the leader is well wedged
under the block. Then he can pass out to the left
and over at the top.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Pitch.</i>&mdash;This is the most severe of the
whole set, and the direct climb up the left wall is
probably as stiff a problem as can be found in the
district. Two immense boulders, one over the other,
separated by a gap of four feet, form the roof of a
cave. The retaining walls of the gully form the sides
of the cave, and the ascent is to be effected on the
left. From a short distance this appears to be a
smooth vertical slab; even on close inspection the
holds it offers appear to be of the most minute
dimensions.</p>

<p>The second man on the rope should mount as
high up the interior of the cave as possible. After
climbing under the first boulder the leader takes a
long step out to the left wall, on a sloping ledge.
Then using side holds on the boulder itself, with his
feet or knees against the main wall, he has to work
up gradually to a little jammed boulder two feet
above the lower one. This is an extremely fatiguing
operation. On to this block he must lift his knees,
and then he can cautiously drag up so as to stand
on it.</p>

<p>The upper boulder is then passed by throwing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
the left leg across to a slight foothold, whence a
thrust forward of the body is effected through wet
soil and tufted ferns. This is particularly unpleasant
after rainy weather, and is probably at all times
somewhat risky. The height of the pitch is thirty-two
feet.</p>

<p>A variation has been found which makes the
passage of this obstacle much more feasible. It
leads first downwards to a grassy ledge on the right,
and then up by succeeding shelves until the upper
level of the pitch is reached, when the return
traverse back to the bed of the gully can be easily
managed. Hitherto all parties, except the first and
third in the chimney, have preferred to avoid the
fourth pitch, and their preference is most reasonable.</p>

<p><i>Fifth Pitch.</i>&mdash;This is an easy chimney twenty
feet long, lined with grass and ferns, and marked at
the summit by a fallen tree.</p>

<p><i>Sixth Pitch.</i>&mdash;Two wedged stones one above the
other form a pitch about twenty feet high. The
route is first into the cave between the stones, then
up a short chimney and over the upper boulder.
The second on the rope should ascend as high as
possible in the cave and, with splendid anchorage,
pay out the leader’s rope carefully. Sundry loose
stones are lodged on the right, and should be left
discreetly alone.</p>

<p><i>Seventh Pitch.</i>&mdash;This is a chimney thirty feet
high containing many loose stones. It is crowned
by a chock-stone. The ascent is directly up the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
first part, and then over loose and dangerous rock
on the right for another twenty feet.</p>

<p>Steep grass leads out to the top, 500 feet from
the base of the cliff.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Blea Crags and Mouse Ghyll.</span>&mdash;The Blea
Crag climbs in Borrowdale can be reached from
Grange in thirty-five minutes; a fine general view is
to be seen from the picturesque bridge spanning the
Derwent. There are three gullies of interest; one
to the south is now known as Mouse Ghyll, climbed
and christened in the autumn of 1897, by Mr. W.
Cecil Slingsby’s party; a second less-defined gully
leads up the centre of the crags; and to the north
of this a third takes us by loose and rather unsatisfactory
pitches to the summit ridge.</p>

<p>Mouse Ghyll starts very narrow, with smooth
walls running up to a great height on either side.
An easy pitch of ten feet brings us to a little platform,
whence a steep, double staircase, with good
steps for each foot, gives safe access to a great cavern
sixty feet higher. Here the real difficulties begin.
The pitch is formed by two huge, overhanging
boulders, one above the other, with a grassy ledge
between them. The leader can be well anchored by
his party, and makes a start up to the left from the
top of the rib of rock that supplies the ‘staircase.’
It is sensational work up to the grassy ledge, where
again the leader requires anchoring, and perhaps also
a helping shoulder for the next little chimney of some
fourteen feet, between the upper boulder and the left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
wall. When the first party were here, a startled
mouse sprang from the grassy ledge over the leader’s
head, and dropped safely at the bottom of the staircase
ninety feet below. May it live long enough to
learn that the ghyll has been named in its honour!</p>

<p>On emerging from the chimney three routes show
themselves. The first is up two easy pitches that
remain in the gully. To the right a chimney leads
by an open buttress to the top of the crags, and can
be ascended without trouble. But on the left a
prominent chimney, succeeded by a narrow crack,
gives seventy feet of extremely tough climbing. It
was ascended by Messrs. George and Ashley
Abraham, who made the second ascent of Mouse
Ghyll.</p>

<p>The central gully starts with a chimney, best
taken on the right, and continues with short and
easy pitches until some large boulders wedged in a
vertical crack offer better fun. There are no further
obstacles.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Messrs. George and Ashley
Abraham and to Mr. Slingsby for the information in
this section. They assure me that the climbing in
Mouse Ghyll is of a first-rate order, and the scenery
of lake and fellside almost unsurpassable in the
country.

<p><span class="large2">Walker’s Gully, Pillar Rock.</span>&mdash;The Christmas
of 1898 at Wastdale was marked by heavy rain
and unseasonable conditions. Several large parties
of climbers had come to the hotel, and, after a day
or two of smoking and grumbling, had departed;
until, at the New Year, Mr. Jones and myself were
the only climbers left there. To keep ourselves in
training, we struggled up through the powdery snow
of the Central Gully on Gable Crag, performed many
rash feats on the end of the barn and the billiard-table,
besides leaving a considerable quantity of our
clothing on the ‘Mosedale Boulder.’</p>

<p>Early in January we walked over to Keswick;
and found, on returning, that another party had
arrived, amongst whom was my friend Mr. A. E.
Field. We greeted him as warmly as we could
under such cold conditions; and when, later in the
evening, we disclosed our intention to climb Walker’s
Gully, he was quite ‘keen’ on undertaking the very
necessary duties of ‘third man.’ Our party was now
complete; but the heavy rain-clouds still rolled up
from the sea, and the weather continued persistently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
bad. We were forced at last to the conclusion that,
if Walker’s Gully had then to be climbed, it would
have to be done regardless of bad weather and
personal discomfort.</p>

<p>As a result of this reasoning, the early morning
of January 7th, 1899, saw the three of us trudging
patiently up the Black Sail Pass in a tremendous
downpour of rain and sleet; but, notwithstanding
this, with the climber’s cheery optimism, a ‘fair-up’
was confidently prophesied. As an exception to the
general rule, our prophecy was fulfilled; for, just as
we reached the soft snow on Looking Stead, the
huge banks of mist rolled up from both valleys, and
far away in the north we saw ‘hoary-headed old
Skiddaw’ bathed in sunshine, while a keen dry wind
blew up out of Ennerdale. We trudged along
through the snow on the High Level, and about
mid-day were facing the ice-covered slabs and
snow-wreathed ledges on the north-east side of the
Pillar Rock. Little was said as we scrambled to the
foot of Walker’s Gully; for each of us fully recognised
what was ahead, and it was better to be silent, than
to utter discouraging remarks.</p>

<p>The rope was put on at the foot of the crags,
Field being the ‘anchor’ of the party, whilst I, as
usual, was placed next to Jones, to serve as a special
buttress when hand and foot holds should become
scarce. A strong jet of ice-cold water came rushing
down over the first pitch, so that, not wishing to
have our enthusiasm cooled so early in the day, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
climbed up the wet, slippery slabs on our left.
About fifty feet higher we had some difficulty in a
shallow sloping chimney, down which a mud
avalanche seemed to have fallen quite recently, and
here our leader remarked ‘we ought to have been
equipped with mud-guards.’ We were soon facing
the main gully, with its tremendous chock-stones
rising one above the other, over which streamed
large quantities of water, suggesting a somewhat
too rapid cleansing of our mud-stained garments.
We entered the chimney and found it just wide
enough to back up, with both feet on the right-hand
wall; the falling ice-chips apprising us of the fact
that hard work was in progress higher up.</p>

<p>We climbed very rapidly for about fifty feet,
close together, until almost within touch of the
uninviting stream of water falling over the first
jammed boulder, which was now just above our
heads. Knowing this to be one of the most difficult
pitches in the lower part of the climb, a short
‘council of war’ was held, for all seemed desirous
of avoiding a cold bath as long as possible. Then,
screwing up his courage, Jones made a bold dash
through the waterfall to the back of the cave.
Knowing his objection to monopolising pleasures of
this kind, we followed him, and were soon all
gasping and shivering below the jammed boulder.
After further consideration and experiment, the
only safe course, apparently, was for me to
stand under the waterfall and give the leader a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
shoulder over the <i>mauvais pas</i>. As our ablutions
seemed likely now to be very thorough, we ate our
lunch and watched, for a time, the falling water,
which, in my opinion, to some extent spoilt the
view. The discomfort of our position, however, soon
impressed upon us the necessity of moving. Field
therefore held me firmly from the back of the cave,
whilst I stood under the shower-bath; and Jones
mounted on my shoulders, from whence he reached
a hold on the top of the boulder, over which he
pulled himself with an exclamation of delight. I
then retired to the cave with considerable alacrity.
Sounds from above warned us that the leader was
scarcely yet secure, so we steadily paid out about
forty feet of his rope, until he reached safe anchorage
at the top of the three boulders forming the pitch.
In following we wasted very little time under the
waterfall, and soon joined Jones on a little snow-patch,
from which we could study the situation. A
hundred feet or so higher, and apparently overhanging
our present position, was the top jammed
boulder. Evidence was not wanting, however, to
show us that we were not safe from falling objects;
for, stuck in a curiously upright position in the snow
in front of us, were three walking-sticks, with two
pairs of torn gloves and some much-worn socks lying
by their side. We thought at first a party of tourists
had somehow reached here and forgotten their
‘impedimenta;’ but our leader remembered that
some friends, having climbed the Pillar Rock at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
Christmas, had thrown their sticks and luggage
down into Jordan Gap before descending themselves.
The snow proved harder than they thought, their
property making an unexpected descent into
Walker’s Gully, and here were we confronted with
the opportunity of acting as a rescue party; but,
not thirsting for fame, we decided to leave the relics
undisturbed.</p>

<p>Jones now led us up several small, wet pitches,
until we came to a sudden stop in a great cave,
where there was no apparent way out, except
through a very small hole high up in its roof; an
outside route being practically impossible on account
of the accumulation of ice on both walls. Jones
remarked that he was not going ‘to emulate the
camel that failed to go through the eye of a needle;’
so, to reduce his bulk as far as possible, he emptied
his pockets and left his wet jacket for Field to sit
upon.  No holds on the side of the cave were available,
so the leader climbed upon my shoulders, but
he could barely reach his arms through the hole.
Field, meanwhile, was smoking and making the most
of his comfortable position. With somewhat insincere
apologies, we called on him to form an additional
buttress, and, from his shoulders, I was able to force
the leader through the hole, amidst the sound of
tearing clothes and muffled remonstrances from their
owner.</p>

<p>I shall not readily forget my own sufferings in
that hole. The first attempt, from Field’s shoulders,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
was a complete failure, because the upper part of my
body absolutely refused to fit the shape of the hole.
After several fruitless efforts and much wasted
energy, I happened to look up and saw Jones smiling
down at me. “That is not right. Go down and
have another try,” said he. He then loosed the
rope rather suddenly, whereupon I made an unexpected
descent upon Field, who was standing below
enjoying my troubles; and there was much confusion
in the cave. After extricating ourselves, Field again
kindly placed his shoulders at my service, but from a
somewhat higher level than before, and this, with
the aid of his ice-axe applied from below, ultimately
landed me at the top of the hole feeling very roughly
handled. Field then sent up our jackets, and, after
the hole had been slightly enlarged by removing
some loose rocks, he came up himself in good style.</p>

<p>We were now at the foot of the formidable top-pitch,
which had never been climbed. A sudden
seriousness settled on us all as we looked up at it,
and remembered that this pitch had defied some of
the finest cragsmen of our time. The walls on both
sides were perpendicular, and the rounded appearance
of the rocks suggested an unusual absence of
hand and foot holds, whilst the presence of ice in
several places caused us much uneasiness. There were
three large flat chock-stones piled irregularly right
across the chasm. Towards the upper one, which
overhung considerably, the two walls converged so
much that it seemed possible to ‘back up’ the last
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
part of the climb, if the leader could only reach it
safely. The only other alternative would be to
climb up on the right wall, close under the lower
chock-stone, and traverse outwards and upwards
until suitable holds could be found. A troublesome
sleet was beginning to fall; so that we were glad to
climb into the cave directly beneath the chock-stones.
A firm ‘hitch’ was discovered in the back of the
cave, by which Field could anchor us; and he settled
himself in a wet corner where his attention was
occupied in dodging the drops of falling water and
directing our movements.</p>

<p>Our first efforts were on the left wall; and by
means of an ice-axe fixed in a narrow corner, Jones
skilfully and safely wedged himself in a crack which
led almost to the top of the first boulder. However,
for the next half-hour his attempts to make further
progress were in vain, for a hand could not be spared
to chip the ice off the rocks; and it was found
necessary to abandon this left wall and to try the
opposite one, which now occupied our attention for
some time. Jones made several attempts from a
shoulder to effect a lodgment below the chock-stone.
Then, whilst enjoying a well-earned rest, we espied
a small rock, wedged high up in the crack between
the main wall and the roof of the cave. That small
rock proved to be the key of the situation, for, after
probably the finest piece of climbing I have ever
witnessed, a rope was passed through the hole behind
it, and we were in a position to attempt the climb
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
safely. We were all suffering acutely from cold,
especially Field, on account of his inaction, though
he declared that the excitement of our movements
kept him warm. Notwithstanding this, our leader,
taking off his boots and jacket, prepared for a long
struggle on that icy wall, whilst I padded my head
to gain an inch or two in height. Jones now swung
up as high as possible on the hitched rope; then,
while standing on my head, he found a very small
hold for one of his toes, and after ascending a few
feet was hidden from our sight by the intervening
chock-stone. The next few minutes were anxious
ones; we shivered with cold, and held the rope firmly
in case there should be a mishap higher up. Almost
immediately there was a rush of falling snow far out
over the pitch, and it scarcely needed our leader’s
jödel of success to assure us that at last Walker’s
Gully had yielded to the onslaught of the climber.</p>

<p>We pushed the leader’s boots into his jacket
pockets and sent up all our ‘luggage.’ Owing to
the half-frozen condition of our fingers, tying the
various things on the rope took so long a time, that
we called forth an impatient exclamation from above.
Eventually we, in turn, landed safely at the top,
after swinging ignominiously on the rope, in much
the same way as our ‘luggage’ had done. However,
the great hitherto unclimbed pitch of Walker’s Gully
was below us, and there followed the usual congratulations.
Our progress up from the screes had
been slow, something like three hours, but much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
time had been spent in reconnoitring under extremely
bad conditions.</p>

<p>The situation was still rather serious, for we were
perched on a narrow snow-ledge on the very brink of
the upper chock-stone; and the three of us were
almost in a state of collapse from cold and the
saturated state of our clothes. The forced inaction
of the leader, whilst we were finishing the climb,
had made him so benumbed as to be almost helpless,
and he was sitting with his feet in the wet snow,
ineffectually trying to put on his boots. We had
carefully kept some stockings and gloves dry in the
rücksack; but the opening of the sack with half-frozen
fingers proved unfortunate, for its contents
escaped, and, with the other relics which had come
down through Jordan Gap, now adorned the snow-patch
far below. It was then agreed that this
narrow, exposed ledge was, under the circumstances,
not a suitable dressing room; so we gathered up
our belongings, including our leader’s boots, and
carefully ascended the snow until we came to a safe
resting place. Here we resorted to the usual means
of thawing ourselves, and our leader’s boots were
restored to their appointed places.</p>

<p>The race up the steep snow seemed to revive our
spirits, and, by the time the dry rocks below Great
Doup were reached, our sufferings gave way to the
glow of success. One little excitement was still in store
for us, for Jones told us that he was threatened with
frost-bite in both feet. On removing his boots we found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
that his statement was true, so we rubbed his feet
with soft snow, and, before putting on his boots, the
troublesome feet were placed as far as possible in the
pockets of the warmest member of the party, until
circulation was thoroughly restored.</p>

<p>Night was drawing on apace; so we bade farewell
to our ‘vanquished foe,’ and were soon scampering
along the High Level, bound for the well-earned
comforts of Wastdale.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Iron Crag Chimney.</span>&mdash;Towards the head of
the Shoulthwaite Valley, which is 3&frac12; miles from
Keswick, near the road to Ambleside, may be seen
high up on the right-hand side, a magnificent
couloir. It runs up the south side of one of the
steepest faces of rock in the district, and is called,
after the rock, Iron Crag Chimney. We had passed
in sight of the Crag scores of times, but the chimney
is so cunningly hidden away on the far side from the
road, that it was not until Mr. J. W. Robinson told
us of it, that we dreamt of there being anything
worth climbing there. He and my brother went to
prospect it in March, 1896, but found it in such a
very bad condition, that after climbing the comparatively
easy first pitch, they were forced to beat
a retreat. They came back, however, with a glowing
account of the second pitch, and spoke very excitedly
about ‘“a thing” at least 100 feet high, wet, mossy,
and with an overhanging stone half-way up, from
which the water dropped out four yards into the bed
of the gully, 40 feet below.’ They thought, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
that a small ledge, up to which they had climbed,
would continue far enough along the left wall of the
gully to enable them to traverse well out from under
the stone, and so reach the top of it. Of the nature
of the climbing above that they knew nothing, but
were both anxious to try it and confident of success.</p>

<p>Continued bad weather hindered another attempt
until June of the same year, when Mr. F. W. Jackson
and I joined the other two and we set out to attack
this formidable ‘hundred-footer.’ The day was fine
and the rocks in perfect condition, and we succeeded
in climbing the chimney throughout. I intend to
give more detail of the second ascent; but it may be
as well to mention here that the second pitch only
yielded after several attempts, by more than one
member of the party, and only with the aid of a
shoulder, given from the little ledge, was the leader
able to climb to the top of the ‘chock-stone.’ After
this another thirty feet of chimney brought us to the
top of the pitch, and great were the rejoicings that
we had, after a very severe struggle, mastered it. I
shall never forget how white the face of one member
of the party was when it appeared over the top of
the pitch, how he yelled to us to ‘haul in the taut,’
how he ‘quoth “nevermore,”’ and how impolitely
he spoke to the leader for having climbed it at all.
Altogether this second pitch gave us a good deal of
trouble, but the top part of the chimney, though
very rotten and steep, and liable to come away in
small quantities, was climbed with comparative
ease.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span></p>

<p>After this, except some exploration of the Crags
by Mr. H. W. Blunt, it was not visited again by
climbers until the New Year of 1899, when Mr. O.
G. Jones, with my father, my brother, and myself,
found ourselves standing at the bottom of the first
pitch. We had expatiated on the difficulty of the
second pitch, and Jones was very keen on trying it,
having, in fact, come over from Wastdale with us for
that purpose. <i>En route</i> to Iron Crag we had climbed
a gully on the west side of the <i>massif</i>, which consisted
of a series of very interesting chimneys, the
pleasures of which were greatly enhanced by magnificent
views of Derwentwater. This had made us somewhat
later than we anticipated, and an animated
discussion was held at the bottom as to whether,
considering the lateness of the hour and the bad condition
of the gully, which was streaming with water,
it would not be advisable for two of the party to stay
below or go round and join the others at the top.
This was decided against; ‘all or none,’ said Jones,
so we roped up with him leading. He soon reached
the small ledge under the stone, and then stopped
to take breath and prospect. ‘Shall I come up to
you?’ shouted my brother. ‘No thanks! I’ll have
a try from here alone, and you would get wet through
in no time up here,’ returned he. This consideration
for my brother was utterly unlike him, for, amongst
other similar occasions, I well remember one on
which, in a gully&mdash;or rather waterfall&mdash;in Wales, he
got wet through on the first pitch, and insisted on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
our finishing with him all the eight pitches. His
look of glee when we emerged from the top of each
pitch with the water running down us was a thing
to be remembered. However, to return, he jammed
his left foot against the left wall of the gully and
pressed his back against the other, and almost before
we had time to see what had happened, was smiling
down on us from the top of the pitch. It was very
disgusting to see him just ‘romp’ up the place we
had found so difficult the year before, and when I
had climbed up to him he smiled sardonically and
said, ‘Is that your pitch? Well, really&mdash;&mdash;!’ A
small handhold had weathered away since the time
of the first ascent, which somewhat simplified the
passing over the ‘chock-stone,’ but even now I think
most people would find it difficult. We could only
apologise and feel small, but, had we known it, there
was a surfeit of excitement and difficulty in store for
us higher up.</p>

<p>The pitch we had just climbed was composed of
most excellent rock, but up above, where we now
were, everything was changed, and the upper rocks,
which had been rotten enough before, were now, as
a result of the heavy rain, of the worst description
imaginable. Great pieces as large as one’s head
came away at once, and every step had to be most
carefully tested before we could proceed. Now was
the time for us to appreciate our leader, for a less
careful man would have ‘pounded’ us severely before
we had made any progress worth mentioning. As it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
was, several big pieces had to be removed, and some
came whizzing past in much too close proximity to
be pleasant.</p>

<p>After the second pitch the chimney continues
straight up and is fairly wide for two hundred feet
or so; but there is no good anchorage until the level
skyline is reached. Towards the top it narrows
down to a thin, rotten and very steep crack. By
slow and very careful progress we reached this
crack, which had been climbed straight up on the
first ascent; but after Jones had tried it a few times
he evidently thought it hopeless, for he shouted
down to us, ‘It won’t go to-day. The rain has
made everything too rotten. We shall have to go
back.’ It was four o’clock, raining heavily and
nearly dark, and to go back meant in all probability
sleeping on the top of the second pitch, an idea
which none of us relished. So my brother climbed
up to Jones and, after consulting for a while, they
decided to climb out of the crack on the right-hand
side. To do this a shoulder would have to be given,
from a small shelving ledge, to enable the leader
to reach the firmer and less steep rock up above.
This was the most obvious route of ascent, but the
ledge looked very unstable and rotten, and vibrated
a little on being tested. However, Jones thought
it might hold if stepped on in the right way; so
my brother climbed up on to it and Jones followed.
By utilising the side of the crack, they were able to
put very little pressure on the ledge; Jones climbed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
on to his companion’s shoulders, and, when he had
cleared away a few of the loose rocks, was, after an
anxious moment or two, able to draw himself up on
to the skyline and disappear from our sight. After
a few seconds he gave a cheer and called to my
brother to follow him. This he had just begun to
do and had left the ledge about five feet, when I
heard a dull ominous crack, and, on looking up, saw
the whole thing coming down. There was no time
to do anything but squeeze into the chimney and
warn my father. I succeeded in getting far enough
inside to escape serious damage, but the heel of my
left boot, which projected a little, was torn entirely
away. My father’s escape was more marvellous, for it
seemed that nothing could save him; but on looking
down I saw the great rock strike a projecting piece of
the chimney only a few inches above his head, and
spread out like a fan into a thousand splinters
which shot far out into the air, falling again near
the foot of the chimney; and thus we escaped with
only a few slight bruises. One shudders to think
what would have happened if the ledge had fallen
when Jones and my brother were on it. It may be
of interest to say here that during the whole of our
climbs with Jones, this was the only approach to an
accident we had, and under his leadership the
possibility of anything going wrong seemed, and
always was, very remote indeed.</p>

<p>After this we were not long in joining the other
two at the top. By this time it was nearly dark
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
and still raining heavily, and on the crest of the
chimney we were faced by a bitterly cold wind.
Jones, who had been exposed to this during the time
we were ascending, was shaking with cold, and he
shouted through the storm&mdash;‘Hurry up! Coil the
rope and then we’ll do a sprint.’ On looking round
we found that he had gone. We finished coiling the
rope and hurried up to where he had been, but could
not see him anywhere. We shouted again and again,
but got no answer. After peering about and
shouting several times we came to a standstill. ‘Is
he subject to fits?’ inquired my father in a most
doleful tone of voice. We had never heard of anything
of the sort, so set off down the side of the
crags in the hope of finding him awaiting us below.
A miserable hour was spent in walking about the
bottom of the crags calling his name; but the
whistling of the wind in the rocks above, and the
swishing of the rain were the only answers we got;
so we set off down the fell-side, and, after floundering
about in the dark, over the stone-walls and through
the river, we found ourselves at last on the main
road to Keswick. We were very anxious to know
what had become of Jones, so hastened home, where
we found him, ‘dressed up in all his best,’ toasting
his feet in front of a comfortable fire. ‘Where have
you been?’ ‘Dinner has been waiting an hour,’
and so on, were the thanks we got for our weary
hunt among the crags for him, and the query of my
father’s about his taking ‘fits’ became one of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
favourite jokes. After proposing the ‘sprint’ to us
he had run round a projecting shoulder of rock to
leeward, and started off to Keswick over the moor,
by the route we had taken earlier in the day. We
had expected him to go down to the Shoulthwaite
Valley, and in this way had missed him.</p>

<p>So finished one of the most exciting days we
ever spent with Owen Glynne Jones; and its events
are indelibly stamped on my memory. But, full of
incident as the day had been, my pleasantest
recollection is of the evening that followed; when,
by the fire and over our pipes, we fought old battles
over again, recalling to life happy days and exciting
moments on the fells, ending with the songs and
glees Jones loved so well to sing, and across the
space of years, taking us back into the ‘dear, dead
days,’ will come into our ‘mind’s eye’ the picture of
him kneeling by the piano, singing with the keen
enthusiasm which characterized everything he did,
his favourite hymn&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><span class="large2">Engineers’ Chimney, Gable Crag.</span>&mdash;This
new and interesting climb is situated about midway
between the Oblique Chimney and the Central
Gully. The beginning of it lies at nearly the same
level as that of the Oblique Chimney, and can be
reached by traversing some easy ledges from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
‘Sheep Walk,’ or by ascending directly from the foot
of the Crags. Although the chimney was well
known to many climbers, its ascent had, curiously
enough, not been seriously attempted until July
30th, 1899, when Messrs. G. T. Glover and W. N.
Ling made the first ascent. Since then it has been
ascended on two other occasions, and it seems likely to
become as popular as any of the Gable Crag climbs.
The scenery is magnificent and the climbing throughout
of a most interesting character, and in the centre
of the lower part of the chimney a loosely wedged
stone adds an element of risk and difficulty, which is
absent from the other chimneys on this face. About
eight feet from its commencement the chimney
divides into two branches, but the route lies up the
left-hand one. A good resting place for the second
man is to be obtained in the right-hand branch, and
he ought to stay here while the leader is negotiating
the very difficult passage over the chock-stone. In
all the ascents so far it has been found advisable to
pass a rope behind and over this stone, to improvise
a handhold, and even then this ten feet or so will be
found quite difficult enough for most people. After
this, another twenty-five feet of careful climbing
brings one to a broad, sloping ledge where a rest can
be taken. From here two routes are available.
One is to keep to the chimney, which continues
straight upward for about forty feet, and the other
is to traverse out round the left-hand buttress for a
few feet and then bear upwards, joining the ‘Sheep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
Walk’ near the top of the Crags. The former of
these involves about twenty feet of fairly easy
climbing, until the small cave, roofed over with the
stone which dominates the chimney, is reached.
From this cave the easiest method of ascent is to
utilise a thin crack in the left wall into which some
small stones are firmly jammed and which may be
reached by wedging across the chimney and traversing
outwards, a slight projecting ledge affording
some help in the process. The ‘take-off’ into the
crack is somewhat delicate and decidedly sensational
on account of the scanty foothold, but once gained
ten to twelve feet of further climbing practically
finishes the chimney. The traverse route round the
buttress is much easier, but it entirely evades the
most sensational part of the climb.</p>

<p><span class="large2">West Wall Climb, Deep Ghyll.</span>&mdash;For climbers
of Deep Ghyll who ascend the second pitch by the
right-hand exit, this new route is probably the best
way out of the Ghyll. After thus passing the second
pitch, the West Wall Climb starts from a point about
twenty-six yards below the entrance to the Great
Chimney. By climbing over two small ledges and
up a conspicuous thirty-feet chimney, a broad ledge
is reached, where further direct progress is not
advisable.</p>

<p>The best way lies around a corner to the right
and up a series of easy ledges, working gradually
back again to above the commencement of the climb.
About half-way up ‘The Wall’ an undercut pinnacle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
is reached and ascended on the left before a lodgment
can be effected on its outside edge, and some
enjoyable work follows until a spacious ledge on the
right can be utilised. When Messrs. J. W. Robinson,
J. H. Doncaster, and H. W. Blunt first made the
ascent, in the September of 1898, this portion of the
climb was considered difficult, and it is probably the
only part where special care is necessary. Above
this the climbing can be varied considerably, but the
direct ascent of a rock ridge, straight ahead, is to be
recommended. The course throughout is well within
the powers of most climbing parties, and the magnificent
views of Scawfell Pinnacle and Deep Ghyll
add additional interest to the ascent.</p>

<p>We are indebted to two friends for the notes on
the following climbs:&mdash;To Mr. G. T. Glover for those
on the Ling Chimney, and to Mr. W. R. Reade for
those on the West Jordan Gully.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Ling Chimney, Eagle’s Nest Arête.</span>&mdash;In
the first edition of his book Mr. O. G. Jones
mentions that there are two chimneys on the left-hand
side of the Eagle’s Nest Arête, ‘the right of
these is shallow and open ... whether it can
be climbed or not I have never ascertained.’ On
October 15th, 1899, Messrs. W. N. Ling, C. E.
Martineau and G. T. Glover made the first recorded
ascent of it, after a preliminary exploration from
above. From the top of the small grass gully which
commences the <i>arête</i> climb, one traverses about ten
feet across some rock to the left, being then in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
direct line below the final chimney. Going straight
upwards, by steep rock steps, an upright slab is
swarmed up with the hands and feet on each side,
until a platform is reached, on which the second man
can join the leader. About fifteen feet above this
is another platform at the foot of a narrow chimney
which needs careful climbing for about ten feet, until
a foothold can be utilised on the sharp edge of the
left wall.</p>

<p>From here some stiff pulls on the arms land one
out either on a broad ledge above the easy gully
route, or up a continuation of the chimney to the
right-hand side of the narrow pinnacle at the finish
of the true <i>arête</i> climb. The ascent, as a whole,
requires more care than the gully route.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The West Jordan Gully, Pillar Rock.</span>&mdash;This
deeply cut gully, or, more correctly speaking,
chimney, is a striking feature of the Western face of
the Pillar Rock, and, together with the East Jordan
Gully, the head of which it meets at Jordan Gap,
cuts off the actual Pillar Rock from Pisgah. Probably
many climbers have examined the West Jordan
Gully, but it does not appear to have been seriously
attacked before July, 1898, when Mr. W. P.
McCulloch and the writer climbed it. Walking up
the bed of the gully we passed a tempting looking
crack on the North wall which ends in a small cave;
above this cave the gully is ‘chocked’ by several
overhanging stones which from below seem very
formidable obstacles. We, however, avoided the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
crack and, mounting a series of jammed stones,
reached the innermost recesses of the chimney. We
were now almost on a level with the top of the crack,
and, the gully being here narrow enough to brace
firmly across, we backed upwards and outwards for
about fifteen feet, reaching the cave without great
exertion. So far we had done well, but still the
great jammed stones, round which we had to pass,
loomed black overhead. Holds for the traverse outward
looked anything but satisfactory, so Mr.
McCulloch, after passing the rope round a conveniently
placed jammed stone, climbed on to my
shoulders and, with considerable difficulty, dragged
himself into a small cave about fifteen feet above.
As this cave would only accommodate one man, I
climbed to Mr. McCulloch’s level, with a little
assistance from the rope, and took the lead. Traversing
outwards for about fifteen feet, I climbed a sensational
forty-feet chimney, which we had surveyed from
above several days previously, and landed safely in
the bed of the gully past all difficulties. The height
of the whole pitch is slightly under 100 feet, and,
from beginning to end, the climbing is of a most
interesting character. The second ascent was made
by the brothers Broadrick, in August of the same
year, but there is no record of it having been climbed
since.

<span class="large"><i>THE PILLAR ROCK AND ITS PURLIEUS
UP TO DATE</i></span></h2>

<p>In conformity with its deserts as the grandest
mass of crags in Lakeland, the Pillar Rock has, of
recent years, received most attention from those in
search of new routes and variations. So numerous
and intertwined are some of the latter that it
would be difficult to say by how many different
ways the top of the famous rock can now be
attained. There are certainly a score that possess
the merit of individuality. However, though there
is one important exception, that of the New West
Climb, the old routes still monopolise the bulk of
the traffic. With the development of the craft
of rock-climbing the once popular, easy routes,
such as the Old West Climb or the Pendlebury
Traverse, have become less used than formerly.
For a moderate party with an expert leader the
North Climb is now the favourite course, though
the ‘New West’ has become recognised as the
finer climb. This recognition will, probably, in
due course make the latter outrival in popularity
its older compeer. But the ‘Slab and Notch,’ with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
the finish up the left wall of the Great Chimney,
still takes most Pillarites to the goal of their
ambition. In the other extreme stands the New
North West Climb, and fortunately so. It is too
difficult and dangerous to attract those climbers
who truly realise that they have a life to lose.
Famous experts&mdash;one of whom made the descent
alone&mdash;declare the New North West Climb to
be unjustifiable. For the descent of the Rock,
especially after reaching the top by one of the
longer climbs, the Central Jordan Crack is most
generally used. Even under the worst conditions
of storm, ice, or snow a rope looped around the
top retaining wall of the crack allows downward
escape to be made with comparative ease and
safety.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The New West Climb.</span>&mdash;Taken chronologically
in this section, if for no other reason, this course
demands first attention. Its outstanding features
are sound, clean rocks, sensational situations with
magnificent views, and secure belays at each section
where they are really required. The climbing
begins about 20 yards down the screes from the foot
of the West Jordan Gully; the exact point is just
below some large boulders which abut against the
base of the main rock. Large hand- and footholds
enable the steep lower rocks to be easily climbed,
though at one point, about 60 feet above the start,
there is a smooth place that gives trouble when ice
is present. About 20 feet higher, a well-marked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
ledge leads to the right and out of the groove up
which the climb has thus far run. Some turfy
ledges then soon conduct the climber up to an
impending nose of rock. After struggling up a
short, steep pitch in the base of this, it becomes
obvious that a traverse to the left is advisable.
The place is vertical, but bulky and numerous
holds enable the passage to be made in comfort.
The traverse finishes abruptly on a steep buttress,
with turf ledges at its foot. On the right a convenient
crack provides means of upward progress
for about 30 feet; then an all too short scramble
up a steep arête gives access to two small ledges
with accommodation for one climber only on each.
The rocks directly ahead overhang threateningly,
and a traverse to the left into the base of a steep
chimney&mdash;the key to the climb&mdash;becomes advisable.
This movement is sensational, but the handholds
nowadays are ample for the swing across. Yet it
is advisable to take the precaution to hitch the
rope over the splendid belay at the beginning of
the traverse, especially if the conditions are adverse.
Once across this section, a large chock-stone in the
foot of the chimney can be utilised as anchorage
whilst the leader moves upwards. The upper part
of this 30 foot chimney is probably the most
awkward part of the whole climb. If the back
be kept on the left wall throughout, numerous small,
but sufficient, excrescences can be found on the
confronting side of the chimney. It would seem
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
advisable to keep as much as possible in the narrow
cleft.</p>

<p>A secure resting-place, with room for three or
more climbers, is shortly gained, and the chimney,
which becomes loose and repulsive-looking higher
up, should now be deserted in favour of an interesting
traverse to the right. The passage around the
vertical corner is impressive, but careful use of the
feet prevents the awkward attitudes so often seen
here. The movement across the face to the right
is still continued over capacious ledges in a slightly
upward direction to some prominent shattered
rocks. Good anchorage is available here. The final
section begins above the shattered rocks, and lies
up a small, shallow crack which closes in about
15 feet higher and necessitates a delicate step across
a smooth slab on the right. A well-marked, grassy
recess is thus eventually gained. The ascent
finishes up this, and emerges within a few feet of
the summit of the Pillar Rock.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Savage Gully.</span>&mdash;The direct ascent of this great
rift, the aspect of which is familiar to all who visit
the Rock by way of the North Climb, is too risky
and dangerous to deserve serious attention from
rock-climbers. Yet from a historical and topographical
point of view the description of the
first ascent by Mr. P. A. Thompson may prove of
interest. Though this indefatigable pioneer was
finally safeguarded by tying on a rope lowered from
near the ‘Nose,’ the party who made the second
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
ascent&mdash;Messrs. Barton&mdash;conceded the honour of
precedence to Mr. Thompson, saying that the rope
thus held could not be considered any aid. On
the lower 110 feet, resting-places have since been
found, and at no point is it necessary for the
leader to take out more than 60 feet of rope.
Under the date June 3, 1909, Mr. Thompson
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Savage Gully was climbed right through by
me to-day after I had examined the route, held
from the top of the Nose by Mr. L. J. Oppenheimer.
The almost vertical portion immediately beyond
the point where the ordinary North Climb diverges
is by far the hardest part of the climb. The leader
must run out 110 feet of rope, and there are no
hitches or convenient resting-places on the way.
The gully is divided by a narrow rib of rock,
between which and the right-hand wall the climb
starts. The first 25 feet present no great difficulty,
but beyond this point the climbing becomes
severe. Backing up does not appear to be possible,
and the holds lie sometimes on the right and sometimes
on the left of the rib, which was crossed in
all five times. These crossings were always sensational,
and, one from right to left, about half-way
up, was greasy. At the top of the pitch a platform
was reached, and an excellent holding ground found
in a small cave between the continuation of the rib
and the left-hand wall of the gully. Here I sent
my boots down, and unroping, waited while Mr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
Oppenheimer climbed by the ordinary route to the
top of the crack leading down into Savage Gully,
from which point he threw down a rope. With
a second man in the cave to give a shoulder the
best route would probably lie directly up the crack
on the left of the rib, but this was too difficult to
try alone. On the right the gully was comparatively
easy for some distance, and climbing up for
30 feet I reached the rope and tied on. This
branch of the gully then became too steep and
narrow to follow, and another traverse had to be
made across the rib, here expanded to a considerable
buttress, on a shelving ledge, wide enough
to kneel on, and with small handholds. This
traverse is the only serious difficulty in the upper
part of the climb. The moral support of the rope
was inconsiderable, as 10 feet of slack had to be
taken in before the traverse could be made. On
reaching the left-hand branch of the gully 30 feet
more of climbing up slabs which, in stockinged feet,
proved easy led to the foot of the crack. The final
steep little chimney was wet, but otherwise not
very difficult. Mr. Oppenheimer came up over
the Nose, rejoining me in two hours after the start
from the foot of the gully.’</p>

<p><span class="large2">The New North West Climb.</span>&mdash;This exceptionally
severe course was first climbed on the
8th of June 1906 by Messrs. F. W. Botterill,
L. J. Oppenheimer, A. Botterill, and Dr. J. H.
Taylor. It is only suitable for experts, who, moreover,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
would be well advised to come to it in perfect
form after a lengthy climbing holiday. Success
depends on the skill of the leader. He can receive
scanty support from his companions at the places
where such aid is really required. Absence of a
dependable belay for the long lead up the difficult
upper section of the face militates against any
claim for safety the expedition may be said to
possess.</p>

<p>The course starts from the westerly end of the
Green Ledge. This is marked <i>g</i> on Mr. Jones’ line
drawing facing p. 254. By a curious error he
named it the Nose. The rocks are comparatively
easy at the outset; some short chimneys lead up to
a sloping slab, where a traverse to the left is made
into a more obvious chimney. This gives about 45
feet of interesting back and knee work until it is
possible to work out to the right, and then up easy
rocks to the crest of the buttress, where stands a
prominent cairn. Broad, grass-covered slabs lead to
the base of the nose of the Low Man, where the real
difficulties begin.</p>

<p>The route at first bears away to the west up some
slabs, and then returns around a corner to a good
ledge several yards long, whereon stands a prominent
cairn. Anchorage is available at this point. The
ledge is traversed to its extreme easterly end, and,
after rounding a projecting rock, an ascent of about 10
feet allows a <span class="large2">V</span> shaped recess to be gained. This has
been called ‘Le Coin.’ Above this important stance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
there are three distinct ledges to be gained. The
first of these entails about 15 feet of difficult ascent
from ‘Le Coin’; probably the best way lies up the
right wall. The first ledge possesses a sound belay,
and the second is recognizable by a larger belay,
which is cracked, but safe at present. A party
of three might foregather here. An ascent of quite
35 feet then leads to a ‘triangular’ ledge, possessing
practically no dependable belay. The key to further
progress here is the negotiation of a sensational
stride around a corner to the left and thus into an
open, exposed chimney nearly 50 feet high. Above
this there is a difficult and risky traverse back to the
right, mostly on a small, grassy ledge. A broad
recess slightly higher soon gives ample resting space.
From the second ledge above ‘Le Coin,’ whereon
stands the ‘cracked belay,’ to this point entails
a lead out for the first man of about 90 feet. The
difficulty and danger of this section will undoubtedly
militate against the North-West Climb ever becoming
‘an easy day for a lady.’ The ascent to the
crest of the Low Man is made up a conspicuous
cleft, Oppenheimer’s chimney, which is reached
after crossing some broken rocks to the right. Two
projecting chock-stones facilitate the ascent.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">“OVER THE NOSE”&mdash;THE PILLAR ROCK</p></div>

<p><span class="large2">The High Man from above the Nose on the
North Climb.</span>&mdash;This ascent can be made in several
different ways, some of which were made in the earlier
days, but, like many variations on the Pillar Rock,
never recorded by the pioneers. Yet Stony Gully,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
which gives the usual route from the Nose up to the
Low Man, is best avoided should the climbers find
themselves ‘under fire’ from another party who have
thoughtlessly gone on in advance. There have been
several narrow escapes from falling stones hereabouts.
At such times knowledge of the alternative ways
up the High Man may be useful. After surmounting
the Nose, Stony Gully should be crossed and left
immediately. Easy grass and rock ledges then
afford rapid upward progress to be made to the base
of the steep rocks of the High Man. All the way up
the sharp, rocky, north-east arête of the peak is conspicuous
overhead, and the point to aim for is a
deeply cut chimney somewhat to the left of a line
directly below the summit of the arête. This chimney
was climbed some years ago; its recesses are narrow
and steep below, but higher up there is a broad
ledge on the right, whence the pull over the
dominating chock-stone can be taken. The climber
emerges on the great, sloping slabs which slant down
the upper right-hand wall of the Great Chimney.
They are an unmistakable feature in the view of the
east side of the rock from the Shamrock. The slabs
may be crossed more easily than their appearance
would indicate, and thus the usual upper section of
the Great Chimney entered on a level with the
ledge leading around and below the Notch.</p>

<p>On the other hand, these slabs can be avoided by
climbing upwards to the right to a broad ledge and
then around the prominent perpendicular nose of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
the High Man to join the easy, ordinary route
from the Low Man. There is yet another way to
the top of the Rock, which was used by Mr. Botterill’s
party in 1909. This runs almost directly up the
nose of the High Man from the broad ledge previously
mentioned. The place is steep and sensational
enough to warn off novices, but the rock is firm
and yields sufficient hand and footholds, though these
are awkwardly spaced. The same party reached
this nose from below by climbing up the outer right-hand
wall of the chimney first mentioned. This is
probably the easier of the two routes, for the rock
is deeply split into convenient clefts for hands and
feet. Incidentally it might be mentioned that those
ascending the Rock by the Old Wall Route, from
near the top of Walker’s Gully, pass below these
more difficult climbs and take a slanting course up
to a small square-looking chimney, above which the
usual way from the Low Man is gained. This
was one of the earliest ways up the Pillar Rock,
and the ascent involves less real hand and footwork
than any other route.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Curtain and Arête.</span>&mdash;This forms the left-hand
wall of the Great Chimney, and may be
climbed from bottom to top. At the beginning
there is a variation which slants up to the crest of
the Curtain from a point a few feet below the beginning
of the fine pitch in the Great Chimney. A
still more interesting method of attack lies up an
unmistakable cleft behind a huge detached obelisk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
on the south or left-hand side of the Curtain. Above
the cleft a narrow crack affords a very pleasing exit.
Once on the crest of the Curtain the work is
straightforward, the ordinary tracks from the east
side being crossed <i>en route</i>. The final stretch of the
arête, which lands the climber on the top of the
rock, involves some exhilarating arm-swings on
capacious holds.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The West Jordan Crack</span> and the <span class="large2">Far West
Jordan Climb</span> were discovered in 1909 by Messrs.
H. B. Gibson and W. B. Brunskill. A poised block,
which stands a few feet west of the foot of the old
West Jordan Climb, marks the base of operations.
From this the ‘Crack’ route slants upwards to the
left over the top of a steep slab to a diminutive
ledge at the foot of a vertical corner, up which rises
a narrow crack. The ascent of this 20 foot corner
is the crux of the climb; above it the summit cairn
is only a few feet away. The Far West Jordan
Climb is somewhat the easier of the two problems.
From above the poised block previously mentioned,
the route diverges at once to the left, and, after
crossing a grass-floored depression, it makes for a detached
spike, about 5 feet high, close to the left sky-line.
This affords good anchorage for the second
climber whilst the leader tackles the ensuing somewhat
exposed section from the top of the detached
spike. This consists of a passage up a crack to the
right of an overhanging block. Above this a fine
arête is gained which leads to the summit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>

<p><span class="large2">The West Ridge of Pisgah.</span>&mdash;The Pisgah
problems have never been considered seriously by
climbers, but this longer course up the whole length
of the west side of the prominent little peak is
worthy of passing mention. The route shows to
advantage on the line drawing of the west side
of the Pillar Rock. At the point of divergence,
about 45 feet above the screes, the left-hand way
is the easier of the two; it regains the direct route
by way of a detached rock-pinnacle.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Walker’s Gully.</span>&mdash;Since it almost seems customary
nowadays to become benighted in this magnificent
gorge, a few notes may be given as to altered
conditions. Those who pay their first visit to this
exceptionally severe course would be well advised
to avoid the ‘watery’ first pitch on the left. If
abnormally dry it may be overcome direct, but this
probably involves more severe climbing than anything
encountered in the higher main bed of the
gully. The best course for those who wish to add
this initial pitch to their laurels is to start up
the buttress a few feet to the right of its foot.
About 30 feet higher a grass ledge is reached,
where a short traverse can be made to the left, and
then the way lies up a narrow sloping scoop for
nearly 25 feet. At the top of this the holds are
rather deficient, but it is soon possible to step across
on to the upper part of the big chimney and thence
struggle up directly over the capstone.</p>

<p>The great cave below the mass of tumbled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
boulders in the upper part of the gully has recently
given serious pause to at least two parties of experts.
The hole at the back of the cave is blocked
by fallen rocks, and considerable difficulty has been
encountered in making the upward way on the exposed
outside edge of the jammed boulders. It may
be mentioned that the blocking of this hole is probably
only temporary; it has occurred before, and
been removed by wary experts. During the first
ascent the hole required considerable enlargement.</p>

<p>The fact that the final obstacle can be overcome
by first climbing up the right wall until the left
wall can be reached to assume a backing-up attitude
would seem to be unknown to many parties.
Even a moderately short man can utilise this
method. Failure to realize this has resulted in
more than one party spending a night in the
damp recesses of the gully. Yet they would probably
find the magnificent scenery ample reward
for the discomfort involved. The great black walls
of the gorge loom gloomily on either hand. To
watch the moon’s rays casting a pervasive gleam
athwart the distant peaks is indescribably beautiful.
But this is only ‘moonshine,’ especially to those
who have watched and waited.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Shamrock.</span>&mdash;The climber who emerges
safely from Walker’s Gully may be glad to know
that there is a pleasant scramble thence to the
lower peak of the Shamrock. This acts as a welcome
muscular sedative after the previously severe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
exercise in the gully. Just to the left of the top
of the great upper pitch a crack will be noticed
slanting to the left up the wall of the Shamrock.
This yields about 30 feet of ascent, and then,
turning to the right, the climber mounts, first
on clean rocks, and later over grass-crowned ledges,
to the summit. After a short descent across the
head of the Shamrock Gully, it is possible to mount
the opposite wall and emerge quite close to the
cairns which mark the downward path by the
Shamrock Traverse.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Shamrock Buttress</span>, by the original
route, affords a pleasant excursion in winter time,
when the gully and greater climbs close at hand
are scarcely approachable. The course starts up
a small but well-defined gully a few yards to the
right of the wide entrance to the Shamrock Gully.
It continues straight up the Buttress, until a high
slice of smooth rock suggests a slight descent and
traverse to the right to the foot of an obvious
chimney pitch with prominent chock-stones. Above
this another short pitch gives the approach to the
foot of a steep rib of rock which is crowned by a
loosely wedged stone. The easy bed of the Shamrock
Chimney is now entered and followed beyond the
short, final pitch which, except under snowy conditions,
possesses a ‘through route.’ To avoid
this pitch an interesting variation can be made
up the steep crack on the right-hand wall, from
the summit of which there is a short traverse to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
the left to the foot of the usual arête finish of the
Shamrock Chimneys Climb. Curiously enough this
latter course is seldom visited nowadays, yet it is
by far the finest expedition on the Shamrock.</p>

<p>In 1909 a party led by Mr. H. B. Gibson made
a variation on the Shamrock Gully side of the
buttress in its upper part. After ascending a 25
foot slab and some easier rocks, they entered the
gully above the great pitch. From a pile of loose
boulders, since swept away, they continued up the
right wall of the gully, bearing at first to the
right, and finished at the top of the original Shamrock
Buttress course. An extensive fall of rock
has taken place on this final stage of the climb;
the place is now decidedly unsafe, and should
be avoided. It might be noted that the falling
masses and previous natural weathering have altered
the structure of the great pitch of the Shamrock
Gully. The left-hand route may now be considered
the easier of the two ways of overcoming
the obstacle.

<span class="large"><i>NEW CLIMBS ON GREAT GABLE, SCAWFELL, AND
AROUND WASTDALE HEAD</i></span></h2>

<p><span class="large2">The Abbey Ridge</span> ranks as the best discovery
on Great Gable since the ascent of the Ling
Chimney in 1899. In the present work (p. 158)
there is a reference to the rocks to the left of
the ordinary West Chimney route up the Eagle’s
Nest Ridge. This attracted the attention of
Messrs. F. Botterill and J. Hazard with a happy
result&mdash;the annexation of a new climb. This was
in the April of 1909.</p>

<p>The lower part of the new ridge is well defined,
but above the broad ledge, almost on a level with
the exit from the ordinary West Chimney, several
routes are available. This section was climbed
many years ago on more than one occasion, notably
when the deep, black chimney on the west side of
the ridge was visited. This fine cleft is well seen
from the Arrowhead Ridge, rising above the big
boulder pitch in the Eagle’s Nest Gully. The
ascent is not difficult.</p>

<p>The latter remark scarcely applies to the new
portion of the Abbey Ridge, especially if the direct
ascent of the <i>mauvais pas</i> be made. A long ‘run
out’ for the leader at this point warrants the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
warning that the lofty sanctuary of the Abbey
is only for the expert who is in perfect training.
The climb begins easily, either at the very bottom
of the ridge or by joining it at a point almost on
a level with the beginning of the Eagle’s Nest
Ridge. The ascent to the top of a conspicuous
detached mass begins to suggest difficulty. But
the real work starts directly above this, in gaining
a narrow grassy ledge which stretches across the
face for several feet. From the extreme left of
this ledge the way lies up the arête until a
steep, grassy gully slightly more to the left affords
a finish to the upper ledge on a level with the top
of the Eagle’s Nest Chimney. This is the easier
of the two exits. The direct route bears away to
the right below the steep and grassy gully until
an overhanging block rises above the climber. It
is important to make sure of this position, as the
rocks are now very well scratched. The key to
the situation is a good hold for both hands right
under the overhanging block. Progress beyond
this crucial point is scarcely safe unless this grip
is secured, but once above this ‘step’ the rest
is comparatively safe and easy. The rock throughout
is of the usual Gable quality.</p>

<p>Two other small variations on the Napes may
be mentioned in passing. In the autumn of 1910
Messrs. H. R. Pope and E. T. W. Addyman found
an interesting problem on the right wall of the
ordinary West Chimney on the Eagle’s Nest Ridge.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
From the big belay half-way up this cleft it is
possible to traverse out to the right on to a steep
rock face which forms the left-hand wall of the
Ling Chimney. This wall can be climbed to the
top on ledges which lead across to the right-hand
edge and then back to the left again. The finish
can be taken directly upwards.</p>

<p>It is scarcely advisable to say that anything
new can be found on the Needle Ridge. However,
Messrs. A. G. Woodhead and J. Laycock have
accentuated the fact that this much-trodden ridge
can be climbed straight up from the lowest point.
The last 15 feet before the old route is gained
require skilful treatment.</p>

<p>Numerous small and unimportant variations on
the ever-attractive Needle have been made. Records
of personal gymnastics are best omitted here, though
the best of all may be mentioned&mdash;that of the
beginner, who ‘climbed’ the top stone by a
really new method. This enthusiast assumed a
position of repose on the mantelshelf, and for half-an-hour
pored over the view over the edge and
down the impressive scree slopes of Gable. At last
the patience of the lusty leader on the top became
exhausted. Though the novice hung on with his
hands, he ‘had to come,’ which he did feet first.</p>

<p>The attractions of the Ennerdale Face of Great
Gable have been increased by the discovery of a
splendid course by Dr. J. S. Sloane and Messrs.
M. Gimson, A. J. Gimson, and J. E. Henderson
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
in the April of 1909. They appropriately suggested
that the rift might be called the <span class="large2">Smuggler’s
Chimney</span>, and this name has been adopted. The
hand and footwork starts about 100 feet west
of the foot of the Central Gully, with about 20
feet of ascent of steep rock. The chimney proper,
which is vertical and about 85 feet in height, now
begins. It is in three stages, and the first part
gives 35 feet of engrossing climbing before a cave
is entered. The hardest part of the climb occurs
where there is an undercut bulge of rock about
10 feet below this resting-place. At this point
it is probably best to forsake the back and foot
method and allow the arms and knees to do most
of the work. The second section of the chimney
above the Cave consists of a narrow, vertical, deeply-cut
crack which bears some resemblance to the
Monolith Crack in North Wales. This stretch&mdash;though
squeeze might be the better word&mdash;is 25
feet in height. The final pitch is almost the same
height, but its extra width will prove gratifying
to stout climbers despite the somewhat constricting
final wriggle afforded by the hole of the
‘through route.’ Easy, grassy ground is now
encountered, which leads past the ‘Smuggler’s
Retreat,’ and thus to the crest of the crags.</p>

<p>In the September of 1908 Messrs. G. H. L.
Mallory and G. L. Keynes found two ‘little
climbs’ on the Ennerdale Face to the left of the
Bottle-shaped Pinnacle Ridge. They can be reached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
from the Scree Gully&mdash;marked B on the line drawing&mdash;by
traversing upwards from the fork towards
a large overhanging crag. This is a prominent
feature of this side of Gable Crag. The new
climbs are claimed to be the nearest routes which
can be found to the left and to the right of the
overhanging crag. Cairns mark the start of each
course, that to the left being the easier of the
two, and giving about 150 feet of climbing. On
the right a steep crack affords for the most part
the means of ascent. The difficulty is concentrated
in the first 80 feet. Where the crack
becomes easier and wider higher up, it is probably
better to end the climb by traversing on to the
right buttress.</p>

<p>A few other minor points of interest on the
Ennerdale Face may be worth mention. For
instance, Messrs. H. V. Reade and G. Arbuthnot
have shown that the vertical crack rising from
near the foot of the Oblique Chimney to the gap
behind the Bottle-shaped Pinnacle may be climbed,
but not without difficulty. The disappearance of
the much discussed ‘rocking-rock’ in the Engineers’
Chimney has not made the ascent any easier; in
fact, the relative difficulty of this section remains
about the same.</p>

<p>In misty weather the foot of the Central Gully
was often difficult to locate, even though the
climber happened to be sitting at it. Recognition
is now a simple matter, for a huge boulder has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
fallen and bridged the foot of the gorge most
picturesquely. Other slight alterations have also
occurred in the bed of the gully. For instance,
more holds have developed on the steep crack in
the middle part of the gully, where the usual easy
route slants up to the left to the Staircase Pitch.
The ascent of this crack is now frequently made.
For those who do not essay the ‘Direct Finish’
there is a steep but not difficult crack just to the
left of the great nose of rock which so boldly
divides the upper part of the Central Gully. The
ordinary route is still further to the left, but there
are variations galore hereabouts.</p>

<p>’Tis a far cry from Wastdale to the head of
<span class="large2">Mosedale</span> to find an outcrop of wet slabs less than
200 feet high. Yet several parties of enthusiasts
have developed the art of finding diminutive new
climbs in remote corners. There are two main rifts
splitting the Mosedale Rocks. These are known
as the East and the West Cracks. The former is
the more difficult of the two; in fact, the pitch near
the top would seem to require the use of a lowered
rope from some friends above if the ascent is to
be made safely. It has not yet been climbed without
this aid. At least two routes have also been
found directly on the face between the two cracks,
and two smaller rifts to the right of the East Crack
have been added to the list of conquests. All are
well marked and easier to find than to climb,
for the experts of the Fell and Rock-Climbing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
Club, usually under the skilled leadership of Mr.
H. B. Lyon, have specialised on the Mosedale
Rocks.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Great End. The Brothers’ Crack.</span>&mdash;Glorious
as is Great End in the winter time, it has never
appealed largely to the rock-climber pure and
simple. But these latter will be entertained excellently
if they join the brotherhood of the new
crack, which owes its exploitation to those well-known
judges of a sound climb, Mr. G. F. and Rev.
A. J. Woodhouse. The crack rises about 60 feet
to the north of the well-known Brigg’s Cave Pitch
on the east end of the crags. The actual crack
itself is nearly as high as that on Kern Knotts. It
is situated in a corner, and rises vertically from a
large grass ledge. This take-off is reached by
ordinary scrambling, though the final landing is
made by means of a short crack. The real climbing
up the main crack, which is here too narrow to
admit one’s body, begins with a slabby section in
two parts, in all about 20 feet high. The crack
now widens, and is available for wedging purposes.
After a short stretch of ‘back and knee’ the most
difficult portion is reached, and for this the leader
would be well advised to thread the rope behind a
jammed stone. The final obstacle possesses an overhanging
chock-stone, but good ledges on the left
wall simplify the finish. The climb is undoubtedly
severe, for the leader can nowhere receive any help
from his companion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span></p>

<p><span class="large2">Scawfell.</span>&mdash;Of late years but little new climbing
of any magnitude has been done on Scawfell. This
is no doubt entirely due to the fact that in the
early days Scawfell was the most attractive and most
exploited of all the Lakeland crags. The present
decade has produced first-rate climbers to an unlimited
extent, but their best efforts have been
restricted by the rocks themselves, and, where these
have been forced to yield climbs, what they have
given us are in many cases just beyond the line of
safety, even for the best parties. Another effect of
this strenuous search after new routes has been the
discovery of many variations, and some of these are
worth description, although necessarily brief, in a
work like the present.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Scawfell Pinnacle climb direct from Upper
Deep Ghyll.</span>&mdash;The start of this climb is described
by Mr. Jones on p. 88. After the first 15 feet
or so he traversed away to the left on to the arête
of the Low Man.</p>

<p>Messrs. A. G. Woodhead and W. L. Collinson
climbed this lower difficulty in August 1907, after
which they bore straight upward over shelving and
fairly difficult ledges for a hundred feet or so, until
impending rocks forced them away to the left.
When almost in a line with the top of the Pinnacle
they struck straight upward from a broad platform
(where a cairn now stands) over a bulge of rock,
necessitating a good arm pull, until a belay was
reached. Thence a grassy gully led them without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
difficulty to the top of the High Man. The climb
is one of much merit, and deserves more popularity
than it enjoys. The exceedingly difficult start may
have acted as a deterrent, but it may be an encouragement
to leaders to know that once they
have overcome this <i>mauvais pas</i> the higher rocks
contain climbing of a much easier order.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Scawfell Pinnacle from Deep Ghyll, Variations.</span>&mdash;A
somewhat easier way of reaching the
Low Man from the <i>firma loca</i> (p. 81) than that of
the arête followed in the first ascent, was found
and climbed by Mr. A. H. Binns alone in August
1904. This is now called Gibson’s Chimney route,
after Mr. H. O. S. Gibson, who repeated the ascent
in June 1907, and left a lucid description of it in the
Wastdale Climbers’ Book.</p>

<p>From the <i>firma loca</i> a traverse is made in the
direction of the arête until a crack sloping up to
the right is reached. This is followed for about 15
feet, and the upper reaches of the chimney described
by Mr. Jones as ‘hopeless’ (p. 82) soon attained.
Here a leaf of rock, with good holds on its edge,
affords moderately difficult and strenuous climbing
for 30 feet until the chimney becomes impossible.
It is then abandoned to the left, along a traverse
which leads past a good belay to the arête. The
first step upward on this gives a pretty problem in
an exposed position. The holds are small but good
until the vertical piece is scaled. Thence the going
is comparatively easy to the crest of the Low Man.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
Other variations have been found from the <i>firma
loca</i>, but, while some of these many prove useful to
a leader unable to follow Mr. Jones’ route, the
original climb is by far the most entertaining for
strong parties.</p>

<p>A good belay about 40 feet up the lower
crack has dispelled many of its terrors, and now
renders the long initial run out on the part of the
leader quite unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Deep Ghyll, Second Pitch.</span>&mdash;It is of interest&mdash;a
melancholy interest perhaps&mdash;to know that it is no
longer necessary to climb up the left or right side of
this famous pitch in the historic manner, and that
an inglorious ascent can now be made through a hole
at the back of the cave. Stones drop straight down
this hole from the Ghyll above, perhaps as a hint to
climbers to play the game in the old-fashioned way!</p>

<p><span class="large2">Moss Ghyll, Upper Variation.</span>&mdash;This starts
some 20 feet to the right of the foot of the Great
Chimney. A few feet up the face a crack is
reached, and this can be followed to a small cairn.
Here a choice of routes offers, one back to the top
of the Great Chimney, and the alternative one to
the Pisgah Ridge. A strong party led by Mr. F.
Botterill first proved the possibilities of this variation,
and described it as slightly more difficult than
the direct exit up the chimney.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Mr. Botterill’s Climbs.</span>&mdash;The long sloping
cracks, the upper parts of which were followed in
the Collier’s and Keswick Brothers’ climbs, were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
ascended in their entirety at Whitsuntide 1903 by
Messrs. F. Botterill, H. Williamson, and E. Grant.</p>

<p>The crack nearest Mickledore Ridge is difficult
throughout, and is, moreover, somewhat earthy and
friable; there is no record of a repetition of its
ascent. The companion crack was the scene of a
remarkable <i>tour de force</i>. Mr. Botterill’s account
of his exploit,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and the warning note sounded by
a party of great skill and experience which unsuccessfully
essayed the second ascent, will probably
acquaint climbers with sufficient details to cause
them to take the climb itself ‘as read.’ It is in a
class apart, and, basing our judgment on a survey
made on a rope from above, we do not recommend
it.</p>

<p>After a lapse of nearly twenty years, and repeated
onslaughts by many parties, <span class="large2">Piers’ Ghyll</span>
was ascended throughout for the second time in
September 1910. Mr. H. R. Pope, admirably
backed up by Mr. R. B. Sanderson, succeeded in
leading a large party up the various wet and friable
pitches that go to make the climb. From a vivid
description, written by Mr. Sanderson in the current
number of the Fell and Rock Club <i>Journal</i>, we gather
that, in spite of the constantly falling rocks in the
Ghyll, the narrow pitch below the Bridge Rock
is practically unaltered, and is still the greatest
difficulty. It is necessary to stand immediately
below the waterfall in order to work up a shallow,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
almost holdless groove. This is very steep; the
rocks are, of course, wet and slippery; added to
these is the uncertain nature and paucity of the
holds&mdash;altogether a combination of difficulty, disagreeableness,
and danger that most parties will
care to court but very seldom.</p>

<p>During the same holiday Messrs. Pope and
Madan climbed from Tennis Court Ledge to the
Fives Court on Pisgah Buttress by traversing
from the right-hand end of the Ledge for a short
distance. Thence they climbed directly up a steep
rock-face for 15 feet or so to the Fives Court, a
somewhat easier but much more exposed route than
that up the crack utilised in the first ascent.</p>

<p>Other variations of a minor character have been
made on many of the older climbs; indeed so
thoroughly has the face been scoured, that it would
be a very rash man who would nowadays come
down to the Wastwater Hotel and say that he
had made a new route up Scawfell.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_3">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="large"><i>THE BUTTERMERE CLIMBS, AND THOSE IN
OUTLYING DISTRICTS</i></span></h2>

<p>For strong and experienced parties of climbers,
with a penchant for boating, fishing, and long
mountain tramps on the ‘off days,’ Buttermere
is well-nigh ideal. Moreover, the <i>blasé</i> ‘Wastdale
Header’ will find amongst the fine corrie-like
combes of High Crag and High Stile, and above
the great hollow of Warnscale, climbs of an entirely
different nature from most of the nail-scratched,
polished courses of his former haunts. Many of
the Buttermere climbs are still to all intents and
purposes virgin ascents. The rock of which they
are formed does not take nail-marks so readily,
and the blatant, scratched foothold, which positively
shouts at one ‘here am I!’ is as yet an alien in
these parts. The texture of the gullies is very
different; it is always necessary to be on the alert
for unsteady chock-stones; every hold needs testing;
in fine, care and experience are essential to safe
ascents.</p>

<p>Mr. L. J. Oppenheimer, in his book ‘The Heart
of Lakeland,’ has made out a strong case for the
claims of Buttermere as a centre for the more historic
climbs, and justly says that ‘after Wastdale
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
Head&mdash;though no doubt a long way after&mdash;it is
one of the best centres in Lakeland.’ The Buttermere
Hotel is in every way a most excellent house,
and to those whose leaning is towards a simple life
the farmhouses in the valley are second to none.
So much granted, it is perhaps as well to review
the work that has been done here, chiefly, it may
be stated, by Mr. Oppenheimer and his friends and
brethren of the Rücksack Club.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Gullies of Warnscale.</span>&mdash;When standing
in the huge, green hollow at the edge of Buttermere,
one has on the north the great face of Fleetwith,
with a long prominent gully almost in the
centre&mdash;Fleetwith Gully. A point of the compass
further round is a bulging outcrop of rock, a
prominent feature in all the photographs of the
Head of Buttermere. This is Green Crag, and up
its left-hand side runs Green Crag Gully, reminiscent
of the late J. W. Robinson, who, with Mr. W.
A. Wilson, made its first ascent in 1899. To the
right of this, and on the Crag itself, is an unmistakable
black rift, which is now known as Toreador
Gully. Further round still, and facing Fleetwith,
is the well-known Haystacks Mountain. Well to
the left of the striking cones which have given the
mountain its name is a steep rock-face seamed by
three vertical rifts, one of which forks into two
branches about a third of the way up the Crags&mdash;the
Y Gully. The middle rift is Warn Gill, an
‘exceptionally severe course,’ whilst the one to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
right is Stack Ghyll, probably the best and most
useful climb in the valley.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Fleetwith Gully</span> is somewhat disappointing
on close acquaintance. There are at least six
pitches, but only two have any claim to individuality.
These are generally moist, and are scarcely
ever climbed, because they can easily be avoided on
either side. Vegetation, water, and loose stones
are the impressive features of the gully.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Green Crag Gully</span> suffers from a drawback
common to some others of the Buttermere climbs&mdash;in
all but the driest weather a very considerable
stream of water tumbles down it. As a climb it is
somewhat disappointing, but the first pitch, a fine
vertical rise of about 70 feet, is quite entertaining.
Above this the going lacks character
and is comparatively easy, although care is needed
on account of the quickly disintegrating rock. Of
a very different character is its companion climb,
<span class="large2">Toreador Gully</span>. After some exploration work,
during which a dangerous huge block was dislodged,
a party of Fell and Rock Club Members,
led by Mr. H. B. Lyon, subsequently made its
ascent in August 1908.</p>

<p>After a somewhat difficult start, the gully eases
off and seductively leads the climber upward to
an 80-foot wet chimney, which is the crux of the
climb. The walls are set at a convenient distance
apart for ‘backing up,’ and for a while all goes
well. However, just when the leader, who has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
worked upwards with his feet on the right wall
and back on the left, is beginning to feel fatigued
and in need of a rest, the difficulties increase, and
it becomes necessary to transfer the body across
and face the opposite wall. Of anchorage there is
none, but the second man can back up to below the
leader, and, firmly braced across the chimney, can
at least support him by the encouragement of his
proximity; whether he could hold his companion
in the event of a slip is somewhat doubtful. By
most careful balancing, and an exceedingly anxious
time for the second man, the leader can effect a
lodgment facing the left wall, whence, with great
difficulty, he can work over the crest of the pitch.</p>

<p>Above this are two obstacles of a comparatively
mild nature. There is no record of a second ascent,
although we understand that this climb is quite
justifiable for a really strong party.</p>

<p>The three remaining gullies above Warnscale
Bottom are those on the Haystacks, to which we
have already made reference. Of these, the left-hand
or Y Gully can be summarily dismissed as
containing too much loose and dangerous rock.
The next cleft to the right, <span class="large2">Warn Gill</span>, suffers
somewhat from the same fault, and, moreover, is
generally wet. It was reserved by Messrs. Oppenheimer,
Scott, and Shaw as a <i>bonne bouche</i> for Mr.
F. Botterill to lead up, and, as the former naïvely remarks,
‘it proved rather more than difficult enough.’
After climbing six excellent pitches, one of which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
a long chimney raked by a waterfall, proved to be
abnormally severe, they were forced to abandon
their project when about 40 feet below the top
of the gully. A way of escape was found about
60 feet lower down on the right-hand side.
This lay up a steep rock and heather buttress
leading to a small chimney which took them to the
top of the crags. The climbing throughout is of
great difficulty, quite apart from the instability of
some of the holds, and there is no doubt that this
was a failure far surpassing in achievement many
a climb which has been brought to a successful
issue. It is perhaps well to note in passing that
the name is a corruption of Warnscale Gill, and was
not given with any idea of deterring subsequent
parties.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Stack Ghyll</span>, the next rift to the right, is a
very different proposition. From below it looks
most alluring. Peeping over the top of the ‘capstone’
of the first pitch is such a succession of
chimneys as is bound to arouse the keenest feelings
of pleasurable anticipation in a climber’s breast.
One can well sympathise with the tantalising way
in which this comparatively short, first pitch repelled
all the earlier efforts to overcome it. All
kinds of theories were evolved, but all were proved
fallacious by the smooth, overhanging chock-stone.
It seemed to be quite impregnable until, after
repeated efforts, a small hole was found on the
right of the stone. This ultimately proved to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
the key to the pitch, and, as was but a just reward
for many previous disappointments, Messrs. Oppenheimer
and Craig succeeded in passing an ice-axe
through the hole, and, by using the shaft as a handhold,
emerged successful. A short time previous
to this the pitch had been turned on the right,
up some grassy ledges, and the gully entered fairly
high up, whence it was followed to the top.</p>

<p>The going immediately above the first pitch is
fairly easy, and leads by way of a narrow chimney,
liberally supplied with chock-stones, to a small scree
patch. Immediately beyond is a pretty 40-foot
chimney, amenable to back and knee methods,
which gives out on broken rocks. Above this an
outcrop of rock bars the way, and after passing
this on the left, one is soon confronted by the last
obstacle.</p>

<p>The gully is here spanned by an unbroken wall
of rock except in the right-hand corner, where is
a fine cave, overhung by a huge block. This is too
high to reach, but off a sturdy shoulder a handhold
can be grasped on the right. A trying drag up,
chiefly on the arms, then enables the leader to
effect a lodgment above the pitch, in readiness for
the others, who will derive much strenuous exercise
unless they pocket their pride and accept a tug
from the rope&mdash;an excellent gully and, if climbed
during dry weather, but little inferior to the best
in Lakeland.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Birkness Combe Climbs.</span>&mdash;The wild
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
upland hollow dividing High Stile from High Crag
contains one of the many Eagle Crags of Lakeland.
This is the finest rock around Buttermere, and
recalls very strongly in shape, height, and general
contour the famous Cyrn Lâs buttress of Snowdonia.
The rock of this Eagle Crag is of a much
better type, however, from the climber’s point of
view, and the fine climb, <span class="large2">Birkness Chimney</span>, made
in August 1903 by Mr. L. J. Oppenheimer and
Dr. Norman Sheldon, is much superior to anything
on Cyrn Lâs.</p>

<p>A good climb also is that up the prominent
black rift which faces High Crag. This is known
as <span class="large2">Birkness Gully</span>, and it affords about a couple
of hundred feet of climbing, the upper part of which
is fairly difficult. The initial stages are quite
simple, and the interest is not fairly aroused until,
high up, a huge cave, roofed in by huge boulders,
is reached. About 15 feet below the dominating
boulder is a huge, wedged rock which bridges
the gully; the climb on to this behind sundry
smaller jammed stones is very pretty. It is well
for the second man to pass the leader when on a
level with the main bridge and traverse outwards
on to it. He can then climb up to a higher cave
immediately below the great capstone and belay
the rope. The leader then comes out to the bridge
and scales the vertical right wall immediately
above it. The holds are small but sufficient, and
the proceeding is rendered safe by the rope held
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
by the second man. Above this nothing remains
save a descent to the foot of the Gully, with a view
to an assault upon <span class="large2">Birkness Chimney</span>. This is
a climb of great severity, and, but for the possibility
of threading the rope to belay the leader at the
worst part, might be dismissed as unjustifiable.
As things are, however, a strong&mdash;one should
perhaps say a <i>very</i> strong&mdash;party will find great
sport and a reasonable immunity from risk. The
Chimney proper branches from the Gully described,
at a point just below the serious climbing in the
latter. It is entered by way of a steep, grassy
corner, dominated by a chimney, generally moist,
of about 20 feet in height.</p>

<p>The next pitch, a chimney, is rather more so
than that passed, both as regards height and
moisture. It can be obviated by the rocks on
either hand, however. Above it is a steep wall of
rock surmounted by a crack. The wall can be
climbed direct or by way of a chimney on the left,
either of which routes is interesting, but not as
stiff as the crack above. Beyond this is the difficult
pitch. High up, a huge mass of rock protruding
from the right wall breaks the continuity of
the chimney and forms a cave. Away outwards,
at about the level of the cave, is a shallow groove
with no bottom; the difficulty is to get into this.
And a very serious difficulty it is. Fortunately
a small stone is tightly jammed inside the cave,
and the leader’s rope can be passed behind it. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
then traverses outward, aided somewhat by his
second, and after a long stretch upward, in a most
awkward position, a handhold is reached. Then
occurs a most strenuous arm pull, with the feet
dangling helplessly, or vainly seeking support on
the smooth rock-wall. Elbows, arms, and shoulders
are simultaneously requisitioned ere a hold for the
feet can be found in the groove. Once this is
gained, however, the work is easier until the top
chock-stone is reached. This demands another effort,
and the pitch is vanquished.</p>

<p>Dr. Sheldon, who led the first ascent, was much
impressed by its difficulty, and likened it to the
top pitch of Walker’s Gully, which he had climbed
a short time previously. There remain two more
obstacles before the steep wall at the top is
reached, neither of which call for special comment.
Near the angle of Eagle Crag there is a long
straight Gully which so far has not been climbed
in its entirety. It repelled a party of exceptional
strength some years ago, after an assault upon it
lasting for seven hours.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Bleaberry Combe</span>, carved out of the breast of
High Stile, contains the small tarn whence issues
Sour Milk Ghyll, beloved of the Buttermere day
excursionist.</p>

<p>As he stands at the door of Buttermere Hotel
and gazes upward at the crags above the water
slide, a fine rift is open to his view. This, which
by the way can also be seen from near Keswick, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
the first climb made on the Bleaberry Combe Crags.
It is the <span class="large2">Black Chimney</span>, and was first climbed
by the late O. G. Jones and J. W. Robinson (what
a lot we Lakeland climbers owe to those two!) in
the early days of their acquaintance.</p>

<p>In spite of its promising appearance it contains
but two pitches, both of which are fairly simple.
Further along the crag to the right, and hidden
from sight of the hotel, is the <span class="large2">Central Gully</span>.
This lacks continuity throughout the greater part
of its length, but possesses two pitches of considerable
difficulty. Further round still is a long narrow
chimney. At present it is known as Bleaberry
Chimney, but we would suggest <span class="large2">Oppenheimer’s
Chimney</span> as a more appropriate name, for Mr.
Oppenheimer was in the large party that first
climbed it in 1908, and the fraternity will welcome
this permanent means of identifying him with
the fine work he has done in its vicinity. To
quote his own words, ‘the chimney is the longest
and most enjoyable climb on these crags.’</p>

<p>Two long, easy gullies on the north-west side of
Grassmoor, suitable for beginners, and another on
Dale Head facing Honister, complete the tale of the
Buttermere climbs, which, as the famous courses
around Wastdale become more familiar, are sure to
attract more attention in the future, and deservedly
so, than they have done in the past.</p>

<p>It cannot at present be said that the outlying
climbs of the Lake District receive much attention,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
thus few of them are kept in a good state of repair.
Perhaps the Borrowdale courses are most visited,
notably Sergeant Crag Chimney and Mouse Ghyll.
Considerable alterations have taken place in the
former course since Mr. Jones’ days. The difficult
central pitch, or, rather, the upper part of it, has partially
collapsed. Though the ascent is much simplified,
the place needs respectful treatment. At least one
leader has fallen here quite recently. There is one
Borrowdale climb which seems practically deserted.
This is <span class="large2">Black Crag Gully</span>. This fine, narrow rift
splits the face of the cliff at the easterly head of
Troutdale, and looks very striking when seen across
the Borrowdale Valley from Mouse Ghyll. Unfortunately
there is a loose section almost half-way
up which would prevent the ascent from being
recommended except to advanced experts. The two
pitches below this danger zone are quite good. The
ensuing pitch, about 30 feet high, is singularly
smooth, and few sound holds are available. The fall
of a well-known leader not very long ago tested the
strength of an alpine rope here. Luckily it was
belayed around a tree, and, though in the hands of a
beginner, it held securely, despite a fall of over 20 feet.
Even trees on a climb may be sometimes useful.
Above this dangerous portion the climb is most
enjoyable, and unique for the lake views it affords.</p>

<p>In the early days parties of keen campers and
scramblers frequented the beautiful dales around the
head of <span class="large2">Ullswater</span>. But nowadays, after everything
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
has been explored thoroughly, it cannot be said that
there is much in the vicinity to attract cragsmen.
On Helvellyn, St. Sunday’s Crag, and Fairfield there
is plenty of indefinite scrambling to be found, but
this is never continuously good, rather the reverse.
Despite its huge bulk Helvellyn possesses few rocks
that favour the climber. Dolly Waggon Pike, at the
head of Grisedale, is the best of all. It contains two
gullies which may be reached from Patterdale in
about an hour and a half, or from the top of Dunmail
Raise on the Grasmere side in less than an
hour’s time. In these days of motor mountaineering
this fact is worth remembering. The best-known
course, <span class="large2">Dolly Waggon Pike Gully</span>, lies rather towards
the westerly end of the crag, and rises, narrow
and steep, just to the right of a series of big scree
gullies which unite and send a conspicuous talus of
scree down the mountain side. Some short introductory
scrambling leads to the real climbing, where
an almost vertical crack rises on the left in the true
bed of the gully. A shallow scoop on the right gives
the best route for about 15 feet, when it may be
advisable to traverse back to the left into the crack
above the steepest part. This is now followed by a
patch of scree above a series of slabs, and short
boulder pitches lead to the final chimney, which rises
slightly on the left. About 300 feet east of this
somewhat easy course there is a much more imposing
opening in the crags. This was noticed many
years ago by the pioneers, notably by the late Tom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
Westmorland, whose name all climbers remember
with respect in connection with the early days on
the Pillar Rock, and the building of the Westmorland
cairn or Great Gable. The great rift in Dolly
Waggon Pike, though often attempted, was not
climbed in its entirety direct until so recently as
1910. Strange to tell, it fell to the lot of the
pioneer’s son, Mr. Horace Westmorland, to lead
the first party. His companion was Mr. John
Mounsey. Their friends have named the place the
<span class="large2">Penrith Gully</span>.</p>

<p>There are four difficult pitches in the gully,
three of them being of the cave and jammed-boulder
variety. Unfortunately a grassy terrace
divides the lower pitches from the upper portion,
making it easy to leave the gully above the
second pitch. This somewhat spoils the continuity
of the climb. The first pitch is not difficult,
and may be passed directly over the chock-stone
after first backing up on the left. The second
obstacle is more trying. The best plan is to
‘back up’ as far as the recess under the capstone,
and with the second man in this secure
resting-place the leader may negotiate the awkward
exit over the boulder on its right-hand
side. The third or ‘Great Pitch’ starts from
above the intervening ledge. Eighty feet higher
a huge boulder has become jammed across the
gorge, with a smaller mass below it. There is no
cave below these, and as the place is very steep,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
somewhat smooth, and always rather wet, it ranks
as much the most difficult part of the climb. A
shallow scoop just to the right of the bed of the
gully enables the lower chock-stone to be reached.
Some anchorage is available here, and the rope may
be threaded to secure the further advance of the
leader. The final exposed section is best climbed
to the left of the crack, which is formed between
the big boulder and the left wall. The final pitch
is vegetation-covered, and possesses a fine bridge-rock,
but the whole of the gully is loose, and the
finish somewhat unpleasant.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Dove Crags, Patterdale.</span>&mdash;This cliff looks
tempting when seen from below the Kirkstone
Pass and near the Brotherswater Hotel, which
provides the best starting-point. Climbers have
more than once essayed the ascent. ‘An impossible
face’ and ‘an inaccessible gully’ seemed
to be the only result until October 1910, when
Messrs. H. Westmorland, J. Mounsey, and W.
A. North discovered a complicated route up the
rock-face. This was about 100 feet to the right
of the really ‘inaccessible gully.’ The overhanging
sections were avoided by some skilful traversing,
and the situations often proved sensational. In the
local newspapers it was stated that a doctor was
present at the foot of the crags.</p>

<p>Small cairns mark the route, which, once correctly
started upon, can hardly be missed, for
there is scarcely another available.

<span class="large"><i>RECENT CLIMBS AROUND LANGDALE
AND DOE CRAG</i></span></h2>

<p><span class="large2">Pavey Ark.</span>&mdash;Despite the exploitation of
Gimmer Crag and other smaller local attractions,
this fine mass still ranks as first favourite with most
climbers who stray Langdalewards. Yet, though it
becomes more and more scarred and scratched with
the marks of ‘hob-nailers,’ one curious feature must
impress those who visit the crags after several years’
absence. This is the curious encroachment of vegetation.
Beautiful as are some of the plants and
grasses which cling to the face, the cragsman revels
most in seeing and climbing the stern, bare crags.
The rarest botanical specimen, if it cumber a handhold,
is treated with scant respect. Fortunately
the more popular routes are practically free from
dangerous vegetation, but recent adventures on
some that are less frequented would suggest that
a warning note be struck.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Crescent Climb</span>, which begins around
the corner a few yards to the right of the Great
Gully, is much spoilt by the exuberance of plant
life. The first 200 feet lie altogether up a grassy
slope or opening. There are steep, shelving rocks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
on the right, but these are not approached until an
overhanging portion supervenes. Then the main
feature of the Crescent begins. This is a traverse
below the impending portion. The place is exposed,
but the hand and footholds are ample, whilst the
anchorage is all that could be desired. After crossing
the rocks for about 60 feet, the heathery slopes can
be gained that lead up to Jack’s Rake at rather
more than half of its length. The deep, narrow
rift of <span class="large2">Gwynne’s Chimney</span> will now be noticed
right ahead, and this gives a splendid finish to
the course. In fact, were it not for this attraction
the Crescent would scarcely be worth the attention
of climbers. The Chimney has walls of exceedingly
rough rock, and an oblong-shaped mass of rock may
roughly be said to divide it into two portions. The
exit is made on the right, and an easy ridge leads
upwards. There is plenty of indefinite scrambling
until the highest point of Pavey Ark is reached.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Buttress between the Great and Little
Gullies</span> at first sight suggests first-class climbing.
Closer acquaintance, however, reveals the presence
of so much vegetation and such an indefinite rock
structure that the place is disappointing. The ascent
had been made many years ago, but no record
would appear to have been made until early in
1910, when the late J. Anton Stoop and Mr. Douglas
Yeomans discovered a route, which has the merit of
individuality. They started from the foot of the
buttress about 50 yards to the left of the Great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
Gully, and adhered as closely as possible to the
main ridge, gradually slanting up to the left towards
the head of a small side gully which springs out
of the Little Gully. The last 80 feet consisted of
a vertical face, with a very conspicuous overhanging
stone at the corner. The face was climbed by a
chimney which had been seen from below, just to
the left of the corner. The chimney consisted of
two parts, with a chock-stone at the top. Above this
the climb can be varied considerably; the upper
rocks of Pavey Ark are famous for their wonderful
gripping and ripping qualities, and they are here
at their best.</p>

<p>A good deal of indefinite scrambling has been
undertaken on the walls of the deep opening at
the easterly end of the cliff&mdash;marked C on Mr.
Jones’ line drawing facing p. 203. Two routes on
the left-hand wall are worth passing mention.
<span class="large2">Gibson’s Chimney</span> is a well-marked cliff in the
upper part of the opening. Large cairns mark the
start and the finish. There are two definite pitches,
which in all afford about 50 feet of straightforward
backing up practice.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Benison’s Chimney</span>, which rises between
Gibson’s Chimney and Rake End Chimney, is built
on a different mould. It consists of a series of ill-defined
scoops somewhat resembling the Shamrock
Chimneys on the Pillar. The place is nearly 200
feet high. It reeks with danger and rank vegetation;
moreover, loose holds occur at crucial points.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
The most difficult section occurs about 150 feet
above the start. A steep bit of rock about 15 feet
high has to be ascended. There is practically only
one satisfactory hold on this stretch; the ulterior
support is grass; and the base of operations is a
quivering, turf ledge, which threatens to come away
momentarily. Thus no help can be afforded the
leader, whose troubles are further accentuated by
a lack of anchorage. The writer trusts that few
climbers will be attracted by Benison’s Chimney.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Gimmer Crag</span> has of late years received much
attention from rock enthusiasts. The shapely
buttress is a conspicuous feature of the Langdale
Pikes, especially when seen from the direction of
Blea Tarn. The full height of the crag, which is
singularly firmly weathered, is nearly 400 feet. It
thrusts itself aggressively forth from the grassy
spur which joins Pike O’ Stickle with Harrison
Stickle. Yet, until the late Andrew Thomson, of
genial memory, described its opportunities so recently
as 1901, climbers scarcely seemed to realise
the existence of Gimmer Crag. There are now
three distinct climbs of exceptional merit and two
important variations, whilst on either side of the
main crag plenty of indefinite scrambling and short
gully problems can be enjoyed.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Gimmer Chimney.</span>&mdash;This obvious cleft
starts at the foot of the Crag to the right of, and
lower down than the nose of, the buttress. The first
serious difficulty occurs about 40 feet up, where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
the direct ascent of the chimney becomes impossible,
and a traverse is made to the right. After an
awkward upward movement has been made it is
possible to force a way back into the chimney by
swinging on a good handhold. The second obstacle
is of the strid variety, followed by a shallow groove,
with the best holds on the right wall. This gives
out below a well-defined chimney, which is difficult
to enter, being, as its engineering discoverer aptly
described it, ‘bell-mouthed.’ Above this a traverse
to the right is made, whence a chimney with holds
on the right wall enables some grassy higher ledges
to be reached. The final chimney is wide at the
beginning, but narrows near the top, where a rib
of rock protrudes and leaves a narrow but safe
passage on the right.</p>

<p>The two face routes <span class="large2">A</span> and <span class="large2">B</span>, with their variations,
start from a terrace, which extends for
some considerable distance across the face. This
is about 90 feet above the commencement of the
Chimney Climb, and may best be reached by way
of a small, slanting gully filled with bilberry bushes,
now known as the Bilberry Shute. It may be
most convenient first to mention the most direct
ascent up the nose of the buttress; this is known
as Oliverson’s variation of the A Route. This
starts just to the left of the ‘Nose,’ and after
about 40 feet of steep practice on comparatively
small holds, a ‘three-step’ traverse is made to the
right on the crest of the ‘Nose,’ whence the way lies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
directly upwards to the ‘belay.’ To follow the
original A and B Route from the terrace a course
to the right of the ‘Nose’ is followed up a rough
slab crowned with broken rocks, beyond which a
sloping rock ledge is gained. This may be recognized
by its having a shallow ‘crevasse’ separating
it from the main crag. At the further and lower
end of this ledge from the point at which it is
reached a leaf of rock, abutting against the base
of a depression in the wall above, marks the start
of a short pitch, which brings the climber to the
ledge where the routes divide. This has been
called Thomson’s Ledge.</p>

<p><span class="large2">A Route.</span>&mdash;From Thomson’s Ledge a traverse to
the left is made in order to continue the A Route;
a recess is soon entered, out of which the way lies
almost directly upwards for quite 40 feet to the
‘belay,’ where Oliverson’s Variation joins the old
route about 80 feet above the terrace. A traverse
to the left is then made to the foot of the shallow
Lichen Chimney, the ascent of which is the stiffest
part of the course, and almost 60 feet of rope is
used by the leader before the second man can be
brought forward from the ‘belay.’ The last pitch
consists of a narrow chimney, with the best holds
on the right wall, which finishes abruptly at the
top of the crag.</p>

<p><span class="large2">B Route.</span>&mdash;Starting from Thomson’s Ledge a
traverse is made to the right in an upward direction
until a corner is turned and the foot of Amen Corner,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
a 15-foot pitch of extreme severity, is reached.
This is a slanting crack on a rock wall that overhangs,
as also does the other wall, which forms the
corner. The best method of surmounting this is to
grip the upper edge of the crack and walk up the
other edge with the body nearly horizontal at first,
and the hands and feet close together.</p>

<p>From the top of this pitch a ledge, known as
the Gangway, which slopes outwards and upwards,
is followed for about 30 feet to a small grass platform,
and the Green Gully rises straight overhead.
This is awkward to enter directly, and it may be
better to ascend some 15 feet on the right, whence
a stride can be taken into the bed of the gully.
For quite 70 feet the ascent is not difficult, and
at that height the leader reaches the anchorage
of the Crow’s Nest. This is a small hollow in the
right wall, and it is attained by making a short
traverse, where the hands do most of the work.
Very little assistance can be given to those following,
as the rope tends to pull the climber from his
holds, but anchorage can be found by threading the
rope behind the handholds which were used on
the traverse.</p>

<p>The gully can be climbed to the summit, but
being grassy and loose in places, it is preferable
to finish up the sound arête directly above the
Crow’s Nest.</p>

<p>A variation which finishes up with this section
can be made by way of an upward traverse to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
right from the top of the 40-foot corner on the
A Route, and this would join the Green Gully
about 15 feet below the Crow’s Nest. It might
also be mentioned that both above and below
Amen Corner traverses can be effected to the right
to join the Gimmer Chimney.</p>

<p>The deep, wide gully to the left of the main
crag possesses one cave pitch, which may be passed
on the right of the chock-stone, but this may be
avoided altogether by keeping to the right throughout.
The other gullies on the west side of Gimmer
Crag afford good scrambling, but here again the
difficulties are too easily obviated.</p>

<p>Climbers staying at Langdale could spend an
enjoyable day by walking over to Grasmere and
thence visiting the crags in Easedale or Deer
Bield’s Crag in Far Easedale. After the climb is
over it makes a delightful finish to the day to
return to Langdale over the fells by Codale and
Stickle Tarns.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Tarn Crag</span> above Easedale Tarn is a
prominent feature in a favourite landscape. Quite
recently Mr. J. Stables unearthed, literally, a route
thereon which gives about 200 feet of quite good,
sound climbing. The beginning lies in a line below
the left of the highest point, and cairns now mark
the way. The passage from the first chock-stone
pitch to the recess, with the ensuing face traverse,
will be found the most difficult section of the
ascent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span></p>

<p><span class="large2">Deer Bield’s Crag</span> in Far Easedale is quite
an hour’s walk away from Grasmere. Its height
is nearly 300 feet; and a buttress runs up the
centre, with impossible-looking chimneys on either
side. That on the left is still unclimbed, but the
one on the right yielded to the attack of Messrs.
Stables and Turner in 1908. They found at least
half-a-dozen difficult pitches, the fourth proving
to be the stiffest of all. The rock on Deer Bield’s
Crag is firm and reliable, but singularly free from
good ledges for hands and feet. Upward progress
is made by using the numerous cracks which are
a curious feature of the structure.</p>

<p>For an off-day there is no more pleasant spot in
Langdale than the vicinity of the Oak How Needle,
which is perched on the side of Lingmoor, below
the upper crags. Its situation is almost opposite
a point on the coach road about half a mile beyond
Chapel Stile when going towards Dungeon Ghyll.
The outstanding mass makes a good photograph.
The ascent of the short side is easy, but a crack
on the front of the rock may be considered decidedly
difficult.</p>

<p>The outline of <span class="large2">Bowfell</span> as seen from near the
head of Windermere is one of the most massive and
picturesque in Lakeland. The Langdale Pikes are
perhaps more arresting at first sight, but a longer
study of the mass to their left conveys a sense of
grandeur and stability lacking in the more famous
‘twin peaks of Langdale.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span></p>

<p><span class="large2">The Links of Bowfell</span> are well worth a visit
from climbers passing from Dungeon Ghyll to Wastdale,
for they offer a pleasant contrast to the exposed
buttresses of Gimmer Crag. Unlike most of our
rock-faces, they have a southerly aspect, overlooking
Eskdale and Three Tarns. The gullies, starting
at the eastern end of the crags, are numbered from
one to eleven, but only Nos. 4, 5, and 6 contain
good climbing. The others are a suitable practice
ground for novices.</p>

<p>It is well to start operations in No. 4, which
has two pitches of interest, and then descend by
way of No. 3 to the foot of No. 5. The large
pitch at its foot is quite entertaining, and upon
the occasion of its first ascent, on a day of
pouring rain, offered a stubborn resistance before
capitulating on the right. Above it, easy going
takes one quickly to the top of the crags, and
thence around to the foot of No. 6.</p>

<p>This also possesses a good pitch of the chock-stone
variety near its foot. The way up it lies
straight to beneath the ‘capstone,’ which bars
direct progress. It is then feasible to work out
under the stone on the right until an upward
move can be made to the top of the pitch. On
the occasion of the first ascent, in September 1897,
by Messrs. C. R. B. Storry, G. H. McKilburn, and
the writers, the upper part of the pitch was topped
by loose stones; even nowadays it is well for the
following climbers to take cover under the capstone,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
both for their own safety and to belay the
leader as he scales the pitch.</p>

<p><span class="large2">The Bowfell Buttress</span> is a more serious proposition,
and as a climb the route found up it, in
December 1900, by Messrs. Shaw, Oppenheimer,
Craig, Hargreaves, and West, compares in point
of difficulty and length with the North Climb on
the Pillar, if the latter ceased immediately above
the Nose.</p>

<p>The Buttress faces N.N.E., overlooking Mickleden,
and is best reached from Langdale by following
‘the Band’&mdash;the long, grassy spur running down
towards Stool End Farm&mdash;about two-thirds of the
way to the top of Bowfell. From here it is best
to contour around to the right and thence along,
bearing obliquely upward, to the foot of the Crags.</p>

<p>The work starts at the lowest point of the
Buttress, and, to quote Mr. Oppenheimer’s lucid
account, ‘after 30 feet of broken rocks, the foot
of a long chimney is passed, and a 10-foot chimney
to the right of it, with an awkward pitch,
taken. This leads, in another 10 feet, to a small
terrace running down to a gully on the right.
The next 50 feet is an upward traverse to the
left, into the long chimney, soon after entering
which a good sentry-box affords a stopping-place.</p>

<p>‘After 40 feet straight up the long chimney
the latter ends on a grass terrace, which slopes
down to the right and broadens considerably;
following this, for 20 feet, a rather difficult vertical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
crack is reached. From the shelf at the top
of the crack 50 feet up, bare rough rocks lead
to a grassy corner. Here there is a very convenient
large block, to which the second man
should belay himself as the leader advances to
the left along a very exposed upward traverse,
with little handhold, into a small rock corner.</p>

<p>‘The best plan here is to climb to the right,
away from the corner, and then to the left over
the top of it, on to a grassy patch sloping away
to the left, beside a fine belaying pin. To the
right of this a chimney starts: 40 feet up there
is a small pitch; then another 40 feet on sloping
slabs to the right with a wall to the left, leads to
the top of the Low Man, where a cairn has been
placed.</p>

<p>‘Twenty feet more of easy scrambling leads to
the top of the buttress, which is separated from
the mass of Bowfell by a narrow neck, from which
scree gullies descend on either side.’</p>

<p>A few short scrambles can be found amongst the
crags above Angle Tarn on Hanging Knott, but the
terrace-like formation of the rocks hereabouts is of
greater interest to the geologist than to the climber.
Flat Crags, and the wild recesses of Hell Ghyll and

but their reports of these localities are quite unfavourable,
except as regards their scenery.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Doe Crag.</span>&mdash;At the time of the writing of Jones’
chapter on this fine cliff, most of the routes up the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
best rock faces in the district were exhausted, and
short variations had become the order of the day.</p>

<p>Doe Crag was the one great climbing ground
which had many new, unexplored courses upon it,
and the almost certain knowledge Jones had of their
existence is evident to all who read his chapter in
the present book. These delightful descriptions of
the gullies are in every way accurate at the present
time, except that the Intermediate Gully is now
ascended direct over every pitch; it is only necessary
in this Appendix to carry the tale through
another epoch&mdash;the Buttress epoch.</p>

<p>This started in March 1903, when Mr. F. Philipson
and the writers made the ascent of the two
most prominent buttresses. Since that time the
various remaining buttresses and their subsidiary
ridges have been ascended in such detail and
thoroughness as characterize the nail-scratched
rocks of Scawfell and the Pillar. These courses are
now described, irrespective of merit or difficulty, as
they occur from left to right as one stands facing
the crags at a point slightly above Goat’s Water.
The nomenclature is that adopted by Mr. G. F.
Woodhouse in his excellent monograph, and by
those who later made virgin ascents on this
magnificent crag. It but remains to be said that,
whereas the gullies are almost exclusively for
expert and ultra-expert parties, the buttresses offer
climbs which in many cases may be safely undertaken
by parties of moderate strength.

<p><span class="large2">A Buttress</span> is the magnificent bastion which
separates the Easy Scree Gully from the Great
Gully. Unlike the other buttresses, which afford
good climbing only for about 200 feet above their
bases, the best sport is to be obtained in its
higher reaches. The climbing starts at about the
centre of the buttress, where is a cairn, but a
vast overhanging precipice forces the climber away
diagonally to the left along a narrow, grass ledge,
which dwindles until, at a considerable height
above the screes, an awkward corner is rounded.
This can be reached by two distinct variations
starting lower down and to the left of the route
described, both of which are very stiff. Above this
a thin crack is ascended for about 30 feet until
a large ledge is attained. Here a choice of routes
is available. A cave pitch straight ahead can be
ascended on the right wall and, after ascending
some broken rocks, a traverse to the right discloses
an interesting chimney, above which the serious
climbing ceases. An easy gully leads to this cave
pitch direct from the Easy or Little Gully.</p>

<p>For very strong parties a fine variation is to
traverse diagonally upward to the right from the
large ledge, treading the upper edge of the huge
overhanging crag already referred to, until a fine
chimney is entered. This is difficult, but the
anchorage is good. A few feet above it an exposed
traverse is made away to the right until the foot of
a most sensational crack is reached. This can be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
climbed, or the traverse continued somewhat further
until upward progress can be made by a zigzag
course almost overhanging the upper confines of the
Great Gully. To Messrs. Ormiston-Chant, Craig
Gordon, and Parker most of the fine variations on
this buttress have fallen.</p>

<p><span class="large2">B Buttress</span> offers several good climbs, the most
recently discovered of which&mdash;the Giant’s Crawl&mdash;starts
at the foot of the Great Gully and, after
striking straight upwards for about 100 feet of
exceptional severity, follows a well-defined slab
diagonally to the right for about 250 feet. It
then doubles back to the left and thence to the top
of the crags.</p>

<p>Some years ago Messrs. R. W. and H. C.
Broadrick made a very fine climb up the crest of
the retaining wall of the Great Gully. This started
from the same point as the Giant’s Crawl, but instead
of continuing across the face to the right they
struck upward over some poised and shattered blocks
and came upon the well-defined crest referred to;
thence, by continuously steep and sensational rocks,
which, however, afford good holding, they forced a
way to the crest of the crags&mdash;one of the best and
longest routes up the Buttresses.</p>

<p>A few feet below the foot, and to the right of
the Great Gully, a wide broken terrace or rake
gives easy access to the heart of the crags, and
all the other good climbs on B, C, and D Buttresses
to be described, finish on this terrace.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span></p>

<p>Some considerable distance below the start of
the terrace, and at about the lowest extremity of
B Buttress, a thin crack starts up to the
right. This marks the start of the route by which
the Buttress was first climbed. The crack gives
out upon a grass ledge about 30 feet above the
screes. Beyond this a somewhat awkward stretch
of climbing brings one below some overhanging
rocks, which entail a flank movement to the left
until a conspicuous recess is reached. The continuation
above this is most exhilarating, a steep
exposed face of rock which takes the climber into
an ideal situation, and which claims his entire attention
in the continuation of its enjoyment. Two
chimneys on either hand have both been climbed,
but the ascent of the rock-face should not be missed.
It finishes on the Easy Terrace. Above this the
Buttress evidences a lack of continuous climbing,
and the time will be better spent by descending
the terrace and thence round to the foot of the
Central Chimney.</p>

<p>After ascending the easy rocks at its foot for
about a hundred feet, a detached pinnacle is a
prominent object on the left. Messrs. Woodhouse
found that by passing behind this a fine chimney
could be entered and ascended to a grassy ledge at
its top. A pleasing variation is to be had by passing
below the pinnacle, whence a steep slab recommends
itself to the gymnast, and, after a strenuous
pull on the arms, lands him at the foot of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
chimney mentioned above. From the grassy ledge
above it the route can be varied in many ways,
but the best sport lies across to the left for a
few feet, where a chimney of real difficulty forms
the lowest of a series of pitches of great
merit.</p>

<p><span class="large2">C Buttress</span> separates the Central Chimney
from the Intermediate Gully, and throughout its
entire length is set at a very high angle. It
offers little temptation to stray from the line of
least resistance, and the climbing is better defined
than on most of the Buttress routes. For a hundred
feet or so the holds are large and plentiful,
but the climbing is interesting withal, until further
progress in the same line is barred by impending
rocks.</p>

<p>After traversing slightly to the right some steep
slabs provide excellent sport until a good belaying
pin is reached. Again discretion suggests a flank
movement, this time slightly downwards to the
left, and thence, after rounding a corner, upward
progress is made to a grass ledge.</p>

<p>The scenery hereabouts is magnificent, and a
few minutes can be well spent in viewing the
formidable difficulties of the Central Chimney,
the greater part of which is now visible. It appears
anything but inviting, and most people will
be content with merely looking. Our Buttress
also has become difficult, and the next move up
some steep slabs, which terminate on a wide grassy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
ledge awkward of access, is one necessitating considerable
care and skill on the part of the
leader.</p>

<p>A little beyond this, on the right, is a steep
chimney leading downward to the Intermediate
Gully, at a point immediately below the difficult
pitch. This branch chimney was first ascended by
the brothers Woodhouse, and is stiff.</p>

<p>The continuation of our climb now begins to
lose interest, and before long we find ourselves at
the foot of the final pitch of the Central Chimney,
whence the going is comparatively easy.</p>

<p><span class="large2">D Buttress</span>, separating the Intermediate and
Easter Gullies, is, in the writers’ opinion, the most
entertaining and prettiest problem of all. In its
lower reaches it is quite easy and apt to disappoint
until, at the same height as the difficult pitch of
the Intermediate Gully, it rises almost vertically
for above a hundred feet.</p>

<p>The way lies up a vertical arête, which recalls
most strongly some of the Coolin Ridges. The
holds are sound and rough, but none too large&mdash;just
sufficient to leave a fair margin of safety in
a very exposed position. This delightful stretch
gives out at an excellent belay, beyond which
the interest continues unabated for 50 feet or so,
until it ceases on a wide grass platform. Shortly
beyond this the Easy Terrace is again reached.</p>

<p>Before dealing with the easy climbs of the E
Buttress, mention must be made of three fine chimneys,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
two of which have been climbed since Jones
wrote his description of the Easter Gully. On
page 235, after he had ascended the first pitch
of the Gully and attained the ‘great hollow’
above it, he refers to ‘splendid branch gullies
up to the ridges on either side.’</p>

<p>Two of these branch gullies were climbed many
years ago, that on the left-hand wall, now called
the South Chimney, by Mr. H. C. Broadrick, and
its counterpart on the North Wall by the brothers
Woodhouse.</p>

<p>This latter is known as the Black Chimney. It
is deeply cut, and looks most forbidding. A closer
acquaintance dispels most of its terrors, for the
holds are excellent, and the fearsome upper capstone
can be rounded on the right-hand side with
comparative ease. It is, however, well worth a
visit, and the continuation up the E Buttress is
not lacking in interest.</p>

<p>Lower down than the South Chimney&mdash;a pretty
problem in ‘backing up’&mdash;a rectangular opening
in the crags, almost immediately above the first
pitch of the Easter Gully, claimed the attention
of Messrs. Woodhouse, Westmorland, and the
writers in April 1910. A heavy blizzard of snow
and hail, which fell at the time they made its first
ascent, suggested the name <span class="large2">Blizzard Chimney</span>,
and this was adopted. It has always seemed rather
a pity that the majority of the names on Doe Crag
are so prosy; the latter-day climbers have lacked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
the happy knack of giving distinctive names to
their exploits.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">THE BROADRICK’S AND HOPKINSON’S CRACKS
DOE CRAG</p></div>

<p>The most awkward part of the Blizzard Chimney
is at its foot; to effect an entry is not easy,
but once attained and an exposed bulge climbed
by the crack on the left, the rectangular opening
is reached, and the way lies up the left-hand
wall of this. After about 90 feet of moderately
difficult climbing the chimney gives out on the
D Buttress.</p>

<p><span class="large2">E Buttress</span> presents a variety of fairly easy
climbs. None of these possess sufficient individuality
or difficulty to demand a detailed description;
the routes of greatest interest are shown on the
outline drawing facing p. 370. These climbs supply
a real want on Doe Crag, and render the climbing
upon it, from ‘easy’ to ‘exceptionally severe,’
graded to an ideal degree.</p>

<p>Beyond the North Gully there is no climbing
of sustained interest, but the <span class="large2">Real Chimney</span>, a
curious cleft enclosed on all sides, possesses unique
features. It is about 150 feet above the foot of
the crags, some distance to the right of the North
Gully.</p>

<p>The <span class="large2">North Gully</span> itself was first climbed in
1901 by the Messrs. Barton, and again by the
writers two years later. Since then it has been
visited several times. After climbing to the under
side of the chaos of jammed boulders which form
the great pitch, a narrow ledge will be noticed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
running outward along the left wall. The feat of
traversing along this with practically no support
for the hands, and a fearsome drop below, led to
the inclusion of the Gully amongst the ‘exceptionally
severe’ courses, and rightly so. Just when
the ledge dwindles to nothing, a good hold can be
reached with the left hand, and then a severe
struggle upwards discloses good holding above.
Thence the going is easier, and the top of the
boulders can soon be attained. Away at the
opposite end of the crags, a hundred feet to the
left of Slingsby’s Pinnacle in the Great Gully, and
at about the same level is a fine crack which the
brothers Woodhouse first climbed in 1905. The
lowest 35 feet are of about the same standard
of difficulty as the Doctor’s Chimney on Gable
Crag; indeed the crack as a whole is about as long
and of as great merit as its more popular counterpart
on Great Gable, and is very well worth a visit.</p>

<p>It but remains to be said that the first pitch of
the Great Gully can be climbed direct up the left-hand
side of the boulder without the aid of a
threaded rope&mdash;a most strenuous effort&mdash;and that
the two pitches of the Intermediate Gully (which
Mr. Jones obviated in the manner described in his
chapter) are amongst the very finest in the whole
of the Lake District.</p>

<p>Other climbs in the Coniston district have been
discovered recently by enthusiastic members of the
Fell and Rock-Climbing Club.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span></p>

<p><span class="large2">Sylvan Chimney</span> is one of the best of these.
It lies to the left of Church Beck, and is the most
conspicuous cleft in the splintered mass of rock
between Boulder Valley and Lever’s Water, being
situated 300 or 400 yards below the tarn.</p>

<p>(Boulder Valley is the fine upland hollow running
from the foot of the falls below Low Water
in the direction of Lever’s Water.) The Chimney
affords about 120 feet of fairly difficult climbing.</p>

<p>A few yards to the left of Sylvan Chimney is
<span class="large2">Gouldon Gully</span>, which gives a rather longer but
somewhat easier climb. A slab of about 70
feet provides excellent practice in neat footwork.
Above it a 100-foot chimney proves interesting,
but unfortunately is somewhat earthy in its
interior.</p>

<p><span class="large2">Colonel Crag</span>, the boss of rock at the foot of
Paddy End, at about the same height as Sylvan
Chimney, has also been thoroughly explored and
climbed, but is scarcely worth a visit; indeed it
is to be feared that the proximity of Doe Crag
would lead to the utter desertion of vastly more
entertaining places than these latest additions to
the Coniston climbs.

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
